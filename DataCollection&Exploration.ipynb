       "'i do audio work for video games: creating sfx in a daw(digital audio workstation) and or composing midi mockup scores using kontakt and a ton of heavy ram use orchestral sample library. the 32g ram on this and the 1tb ssd is a HUGE boon for audio work! i use both ableton and reaper daw. they load super snappy. my kontakt heavy projects load ultra fast now (versus the pc tower i was using, which was still quite powerful).\\n\\nthe laptop runs fairly quiet even at heavier cpu loads. i composed a piece of music for a game of thrones video game which ran about 60-70% cpu on my other, fastest computer(the pc tower). this hp laptop, it clocks in at a cool 50%. so ive been able to have tons of cpu intense plugins (such as ozone8 or reaktor) running in the daw projects no problem. i was able to turn the cpu down to 0% in the windows power management panel and set the cooling to passive- which causes the laptop to run slower, but basically run silent because less heat generation. which is perfect when i need to record foley or my own voice for use with creatures in the games. i can then turn the cpu back up to full speed when composing or integrating the sound and music into the games.\\n\\nthe graphics card on this isnt 100% the best but im still able to run unity and hook up sounds into 3d games that way without any lag via a 2k screen. really this isnt a gaming pc (only due to the level/integration of its graphics card) like you might not be able to easily run the latest greatest fps at full settings and stream on twitch at the same time without some drop in frame rate(but who knows maybe u can? i didnt test this fully), but im confident you could still run just about any game regardless (w tweaked setting most likely).\\n\\njust as a test i loaded up one of my all time fav games: skyrim, and one of the heftier mods and it seemed to run amazingly well in 2k (with all the game\\'s graphics settings turned up). i havent tried video capturing a game like that but with the right settings in obs i think it could work fine (probably no more than 60fps id imagine).\\n\\ni do do a lot of video capturing for my job: getting animations and vfx clips to bring into the daw to make sound effects with and so far this laptop does not even blink w those basic vid cap tasks.\\n\\ni also do photography and video editing on the side for my own projects. photoshop runs like a total breeze on this! ive never had a smoother photoshop experience, personally. after effects is fast to edit/splice preview etc but some of the render times (especially when using twixtor) still take time. a 20 minute time stretched(200% vector blend) 2k video with color correction and film grain layers added took about 2+hr to render. so obvs not the best laptop out there for major video effects work but i think still totally doable and capable for those working more in the premiere type video editing layout arena.\\n\\nmy only complaint is that the laptop feels cheapo plastic (this is my first non mac in a while so theres that) so for work-traveling(which is why i ultimately got this) i think ill need to get a good solid case and just treat this like a newborn baby during its life span.\\n\\nwith the crazy power of this thing, given the requirements of my audio/photoshop work, i think this will be a super solid computer for me for the next 10years at least. and for $800 what a crazy steal! I\\'ve had this laptop for a week now, which has been enough time for me to gauge my issues with it:\\n\\n- - Speaker volume auto-adjusts (video footage provided) - -\\n\\nI\\'ve troubleshooted this through every process suggested online, and can\\'t seem to find a solution or explanation. Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it\\'ll cut to a lower volume and then stay there. And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again, it\\'ll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume. This happens exclusively with the speaker, as in the headphones work just fine. I\\'ve turned off enhancements, changed every setting in the control panel sound settings, options sound settings, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled B&O. Nothing fixes the issue, and it\\'s very noticeable. I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers (the volume fluctuating is that noticeable).\\n\\n- - Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it\\'s hard to see regardless, with heavy resistance - -\\n\\nNow I wouldn\\'t mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing. But in this case, the keyboard does not have lit keys, has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it\\'s hard to make out what they keys are, and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press. Think of like a membrane keyboard, but just a little more resistant than that. Very clicky/noisy too. I could get used to it all, but with the sound issue I mentioned above, it doesn\\'t feel so great.\\n\\n- - 6-bit color bit depth? - -\\n\\nI do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use (phone and computer monitor). Then when I found that the display was set as a 6-bit color bit depth, I realized that this might be the reason why. After searching all around online to see if this was changeable, I\\'ve concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself. Not the best, and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed.\\n\\nAnd then here are some non-issues that I\\'ve faced (as in things I\\'ve been frustrated with, but it\\'s not that big of a deal).\\n\\n- It comes preloaded with Windows 11 (I just downloaded 10 and did a fresh reboot with that)\\n- Battery life isn\\'t the greatest, but I wasn\\'t expecting much in that department\\n- So much bloatware, but I guess that\\'s more the fault of Microsoft than HP, since Windows 10 includes all kinds of useless crap (that I spent roughly 6 hours removing)\\n\\nEverything else has been great. If I can just get used to the keyboard (the placement of every key, and the \"weight\" of them), and as long as I always use headphones or the volume problem magically fixes itself (I might just seek specific support in regards to this), then this seems like a purchase generally worth $880. I\\'ll just have to accept less than ideal color depth (it\\'s not that bad tbf). I wouldn\\'t mind spending a few hundred more to fix these issues, and maybe have separate action keys that aren\\'t the same as the function keys (since I use those quite often). I might consider that, but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school, which I know this will suffice for now. This is by far the fastest laptop I have ever owned. It starts up very quickly and shuts down quickly. When you open an excel file, the file opens before the click of the mouse fades away.\\n8 core processer\\n32 GB of memory\\n1 TB solid state drive\\nExtended display with little display border\\nNice display\\nVery thin and light\\nThe people who put in the upgrades must have used soft gloves because the computer did not have a scratch on it and started up as a brand new computer.\\n\\nAll for $910 including tax is an incredible value.\\n\\nI do agree with one reviewer that the letters on the key could be more white if color to see them easier, but that is such a minor issue to all of the plusses.\\n\\nIf your current laptop has become sloe for you, this is a great replacement at a more than reasonable price. It worth Everything is great, only the color of the keyboard is a little uncomfortable. The Ryzen chip is very fast and there is no lag with the video response with the onboard Radeon graphics. I\\'m thrilled with the 32 GB of RAM and the 1 TB SSD It\\'s an incredible little powerhouse and clearly with the $899 price tag. My only problem with the computer is the poor design of the keyboard !!! Okay, I knew going in that the keyboard wasn\\'t BACKLIT, but I never thought they would be STUPID enough to have BLACK keys with CHARCOAL LETTERING !!! It makes it nearly impossible to use in low-light environments. I had to resort to propping a small flashlight against my head and shoulder to illuminate the keyboard adequately to see what I was typing. I( later ordered a USB LED light to provide the light source, but really ... WHY NOT A BRIGHT WHITE LETTERING ON THE BLACK KEYES ??? SMFH I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop\\'s body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don\\'t need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.\\n\\nI haven\\'t found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don\\'t see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination. I like this HP Pavilion. I\\'ve owned several HP computers and printers before, I\\'m currently using an HP printer and this computer is the one I\\'m now reviewing. It works great, I\\'m able to type this review with no worries, there have only been a few minor glitches, all fixable by me. So far at least. HP has a lot of great support services in general, and this hard drive is just under one terabyte, they never seem to make it up to the full hard drive status they advertise. And I\\'m worried about defragmenting the drive, it\\'s a solid state drive and you can\\'t really defragment a drive of that type without harming the machine. Or the hard drive. So I\\'m hoping it will be okay, and I can manage without using defragmentation services. I\\'ve had this computer for a couple of weeks now. I paid about $1000 including tax (CA). Not a lot of computer makers offer a Ryzen 7-5700U, yet. With 32MB of RAM and 1TB SSD it\\'s almost a steal.\\nIt doesn\\'t offer frills like folding back the display, touch screen, or lighted keys. But what I would have liked is Windows 11 Professional instead of Home and School.\\nI made it dual boot, and installed openSUSE Leap 15.3 next to Windows. The dual boot works fine. However, I haven\\'t been successful yet getting the Ryzen to work at full resolution. That\\'s not HP\\'s fault, but rather AMD which doesn\\'t provide its Radeon drivers as public domain.\\nOverall, so far I\\'m happy with this computer. I hope it will last a long time. Bought this for our son for college but hasn\\'t been used much yet. He seems pleased with it so far. Mic doesn\\'t pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good. laptop looks great screen is worderfull specs are great and gives power no backlite to see keyboard but overall laptop is great good quality and good value for money A laptop with excellent capacity...games and programs run very well, I can work comfortably without crashes I have had the laptop for a few days and I am pleased with what I have experienced thus far. The body is rigid, The performance speed is impressive. I recommend it without hesitation. It was nice to find this laptop with upgraded RAM. I needed a new laptop for the graduate level. I do mapping and basic photogrammetry, so I\\'ve just installed AutoCAD, ReCap, QGIS, and Metashape. So far, everything has been running smoothly. Although the fan begins to sound, I think is normal. Very cheap amazing laptop for work. I use this laptop for coding and it is very efficient at the job! It\\'s amazing how a 32gb, 1tb ssd, 16 core laptop can be this cheap! The only thing I find a bit annoying is that I need to charge at least once a day for my 9-5 job, but I guess it is expected due to the high end requirements. I purchased this in March. Right away, the unit was going to sleep an I could only wake it by using the power button to turn it off and on; a 5-star HP tech fixed that. A couple of weks ago it started freezing and turning off. After several hours on a bad phone connection, they decided to send me a USB recovery drive, which wiped Windows and all the applications. After doing that and reloading the apps, it started again. This time it was shutting down because of Windows errors. Finally, Microsoft told me that it was no-doubt a hardware issue, but showed me how to reload Windows 11 in a way that would keep my files and apps in place. Told me that should fix it, unless it is a hardware issue. Didn\\'t work. I leave for an hour, come back, and it\\'s re-booted. I\\'m a small business man that relies 100% on my computer. HP\\'s solution is to send me a postage-paid box for me to pack the computer and send back to them so they can repair it. Meantime, I\\'m left without a way to communicate with and service my customers. I used to use HP inkjet printers. They were good for about a year before dying. I\\'m through with HP. Bought myself a nice Lenovo for a great price at Costco today. Anybody wants a doorstop - you can have one - just pay the postage I am very satisfied with this product.\\n- Quick Start Up, thank for SSD drive\\n- Fast performance, thank for Ryzen 7\\n- Great for multi task, 32GB RAM\\n- Battery last for a long time Excellent equipment, it is quite fast, the screen resolution is very good, aesthetically it is very beautiful, super light in weight I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc. Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great. Not a single complaint. Love it! Very fast and loaded with all the Hp & MS Windows & Office tools to get up and running. To fast and good quality I don\\'t recommend this computer. I am having lots of issues with connecting to WiFi at my house. The old computers located in the same area as this new laptop are connecting as expected. I work in a hybrid role, and I need this laptop to be able to connect to WiFi wherever I am.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m going to have to take this to the shop since I\\'m outside the return period. Do not buy this computer from this seller.\\n\\nYou have been warned. We ordered a unit with Win 11 Pro. 64 bit\\nWe received Win 11 Home will not work with our software, so we sent it back THE FBA SELLER HAS NOT CALLED ME (AS PROMISED BY AMAZON) AND I AM UNABLE TO REACH THEM. THE VIDEO CAMERA (FOR ZOOMS) DOESN\\'T WORK AND THEY REVISED THE SOFTWARE BUT AMAZON IS SAYING TO CONTACT HP! DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZING WAREHOUSE DEALS! The computer is amazing, however there are manufacturer issues and in order to resolve you have to downgrade your windows. Thanks for the support during installation... I love for the fact that its very fast, monitor is super clear, keyboard is good other than its lightweight and the price it very considerate. It\\'s a awesome... Truly appreciated. I am pleased with this one. Bought it to do some development on and it\\'s handling things nicely. I use this laptop for programming and reverse engineering and it\\'s so powerful! I am currently running two text editors, a terminal window and a browser with 14 open tabs and everything works perfectly! The machine boots in a second and launches applications even faster! I\\'m soo loving this PC! I trade stocks and crypto, so it works great for that. I can send all my crypto into my cold wallet and not worry about it being lost on an exchange. Arrived on time and safely packaged. The outer box was heavily damaged but thanks to the good packing job there wasn\\'t a dent or scratch on the actual packaging. The laptop itself is pristine, to the point I was doubtful of the claimed upgrades but everything checked out as advertised.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure how much difference I would see in speed but this is lightning fast and very responsive. The touch pad and keyboard are crisp and smooth, the display is excellent for 1080. The OS is Windows 11 home and I\\'m pleasantly surprised how decent it is.\\n\\nOverall very pleased with the purchase so far. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen. Turns out it was too good to be true. That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download, videos I watch, or updates I complete. They lied to most of us or they’re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color. It\\'s great. Better than my old one. Great for the money spent. Haven’t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home, and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though. I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too. Ive just received this laptop, and its already running like it has hundreds of viruses, slow af, cant enjoy any games, takes years to get to any website, I gave up on deleting the hundreds of apps that are pre installed, because how long it takes. if youre looking to get a good laptop, dont expect nothing good this cheap I guess. Nothing is able to be saved on this computer. I\\'m returning it.\\nRecommend DI NOT BUY. I love the color the screen looks great but it\\'s too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished.\\nVery upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already.\\n\\nWhile I was working, it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere ( see pics)\\nIt happened multiple times!\\nThis last time the screen wouldn\\'t come back, and I had to turn off and turn on again.\\n\\nNot reliable. I had it for a week only. I will be returning this.\\nI spent extra $100 and got a brand new one….\\n\\nToo risky! Easy set up and love the color Great purchase. Was a little scared at first to get but I’m happy I did. To replace a later hp laptop. Needed something smaller. More for ME!! Arrived like new. Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work , was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid. It is a great little laptop. I love finding these great buys in the refurbished/renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer. It doesn’t say it in the description. The comments made me think so. It came in perfect condition basically brand new. A little slow but very worth it! I’ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it’s literally a steel At first it was taking forever (3mins and a blank screen) to log in. I was ready to take it back. Then I tried to update and restart, then it started up right away. Hopefully this can handle my daughter\\'s first year of college! So far, not bad for price. The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor. Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer. 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, extra storage slot. Battery lasts a very long time. I have Windows 11...which works great!! I love it. It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer! This was a great buy. It’s a keeper for sure. Price can’t be bet. Great product.\\nThanks Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill. It came with Windows 11 which seemed to work well. Had no trouble with setup. It is lightweight and for a refurbished item. it looked brand new. My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming. It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine. It does not come with a CD/DVD player. I use flash drives to transfer data and programs. A 5 star buy. Works great. I got this a few months ago and it works fine. the screen is tearing /flickering but It was something I installed and not a hardware problem. But it works as expected. The machine itself seems pretty nice. It is way faster than my old machine. I was able to run two external monitors once I got the right cable. I\\'m not a gamer. I just run a few business applications.\\n\\nGet the bigger disk. I got 256 and should have gotten the larger disk because after updating windows with all its patches I only have about 100GB free.\\n\\nBEWARE OF THIS SELLER. I was very surprised to buy a \"new\" machine and find out when I got it that it was manufactured in 2020 and the HP warranty is already over. I contacted the seller to see if they would pay to extend the warranty and got no response from them or Amazon. Maybe buy this somewhere else or make sure you get a warranty included. I needed a new laptop for gaming, streaming, etc. I went with HP because my old HP laptop is 6 years old and still works fairly well and that impressed me that I was getting something new that would last awhile. But, as always happens, it had become frustratingly technically out-of-date for running some games and was also very slow due to low free memory. This new model is tons more powerful and triple the memory. I have yet to find a game I was unable to play on it and watching videos/streams is mostly without flaw. Battery life is not great, I would imagine because of the amount of energy it needs to be as cool as it is. This was not a deal-breaker for me because I really wasn\\'t getting it for portable use anyway, so mine is always plugged in. 2 relatively minor issues I\\'ve had should be noted: The keyboard is backlit but this model turns off the backlighting after about 10 seconds of you not typing. As far as I\\'m concerned that defeats the purpose of the feature in that it doesn\\'t remain constantly lit in the dark. There are no BIOS or other setting options to change this so it\\'s a little annoying. Secondly, there seems to be a slight problem with the volume when watching movies off of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. At MAXIMUM speaker volume and MAXIMUM stream volume, the sound is acceptable but you can\\'t get it any higher than an average output. It does NOT, however, have this problem when playing games, so I dunno what\\'s up with that. I contacted HP about it, but they\\'ve never gotten back to me on it. I\\'ve found it to be a pretty minor annoyance though as if needs be I can still use my old laptop if I need to watch something at a louder volume. All in all, I\\'m pretty happy with this model, though I\\'ll update this review if anything new, good or bad, comes up with it. I decided to wait 3 months of using it before offering my opinion, and there you have it. ;) Laptop is great for gaming, and streaming however the battery on it is TERRIBLE. Unless it is plugged in, I get maybe two hours of usage out of it… and that’s pushing it. I would say closer to an hour even with the keyboard lights off and the brightness down. Otherwise it’s a good somewhat affordable gaming laptop Let me start by saying it IS a laptop. I needed one to replace my aging laptop so that I could be up to speed since I am a college student, so it needed to have storage capabilities, speed, and be able to handle various processes with a decent battery. At moderate usage, the battery usually lasts about 5-7 hrs, having multiple tabs open, software compilers, etc. I strongly dislike MacAfee, so I uninstalled that right off the bat and use a different antivirus. This laptop is great for needing to be on the go since it is not large, and it also sports Wifi and ethernet ports, which can work in tandem with each other (connect to both at the same time). The RAM can also be upgraded, which I plan to upgrade the 4GB stick to an 8GB stick at some point. My biggest dislike is Windows 10. This laptop is forcing me to develop new skills. It is a huge departure from the Vista OS that took me forever to become comfortable with. I bought this laptop to replace my old laptop because the Vista OS wasn\\'t getting updates. I primarily use the laptop as a storage device for images and music. I am not a gamer other than The Solitaire Suite; which I like very much on this computer. I do surf the web and shop with the device also. I can\\'t comment on the battery life or the gaming capabilities of this laptop. I really am not sure whether it is a good value. I know it cost more than I expected considering it doesn\\'t have a DVD burner or player. I like and appreciate the upgraded Ram and Hard drive space compared to my old Laptop. I really didn\\'t want to buy a laptop that relied on the cloud as I use the device in areas where I don\\'t have internet access. Do I like it? Yes I do! ive seen people say that the battery life isn\\'t good, but I don\\'t think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.\\nive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they\\'ll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked. I actually prefer that to minimize battery use.\\nwhile using without gaming, the battery life is actually pretty good.\\nso far ive played terraria and fallout 76, and they both play great on ultra settings. I think im going to install battlefield 5 and see how it runs. not a big fan of the game itself, but that\\'s the most resource intense game I own, kinda curious how itll run.\\nthe laptop is more than vr ready\\nI love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing.\\noh, ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving.... mine didn\\'t either, YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY, LOL\\noh, and I also received the laptop within a day and a half. ordered friday night, and got it sunday.\\noverall I highly recommend Awesome laptop. I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop. The size is great, it’s in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this. And Pink! I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do. touch screen works perfectly. This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I\\'m very happy with it for the price. light weight, easy to use I\\'m very satisfied. Not a single scratch or issue. Beautiful color also. 😍 Very easy to use. Quite fast. Excellent for the money. For the price it\\'s a great deal I’ve had it for about two months. So far so good. I don’t use it for gaming or anything like that. Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media. I like the slim design of the HP Laptop.\\nIts very light, no extra battery to replace.\\nEasy to do work on, battery life is excellent so far.\\nScreen quality is great, sound quality is also very nice\\n\\nI love mine The laptop is light and very sleek. It doesn\\'t run slow. It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices. I play games sometimes and it doesn\\'t lag. FYI No this is not touch screen. The laptop came with the charger. Delivery was prompt, and the laptop was in excellent condition. It was very easy to set up. Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos, play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work. Great laptop and a terrific price. I am very pleased with my laptop. As functional as it is beautiful. exellent product good quality i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds! A great buy! I love the touch screen the most! Lol but overall great investment! The computer works just fine, but I cant activate Windows 11 due to no windows product key. Low cost. Works good. Would buy again. I received this laptop in great condition, however it didn\\'t come with a charging cable. My only option was to return the entire thing/get a replacement or buy a cord separately. I didn\\'t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included, and I saw other customer photos that included it. I\\'m annoyed that I\\'ll have to pay for one separately, or go through the hassle or returning and recording it. Love this computer. Work great! Love the color. I didn’t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised. Easy to start up walks you right through start up. Great price. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen.

I love finding these great buys in the refurbished/renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer. It doesn’t say it in the description. The comments made me think so. It came in perfect condition basically brand new. A little slow but very worth it! I’ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it’s literally a steel At first it was taking forever (3mins and a blank screen) to log in. I was ready to take it back. Then I tried to update and restart, then it started up right away. Hopefully this can handle my daughter\\'s first year of college! So far, not bad for price. The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor. Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer. 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, extra storage slot. Battery lasts a very long time. I have Windows 11...which works great!! I love it. It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer! Not as easy as I expected. Ideal for studies. Perfect for traveling. Wife loves the light weight and ease of use. Fast on and off too. You can’t use anything Microsoft. This one is not touch screen, but for the price, it’s perfect and I am able do use it for what I need. I love my laptop. My wife uses it more than I do. Lol Great little machine If you are old like me it\\'s not great. But kids use it for school work. I used it as a backup in clinic when my computer froze and it worked perfectly. Just make sure u use your bifocals I purchased two of these items both of them had the same display problem which when I opened up a web page everything looked fine then when I went into it like let\\'s say Netflix it looked like x-ray people like high contrast was on and it wasn\\'t I opened up other web pages the same thing on two laptops, I got the same thing I don\\'t know if anybody else is experiencing this but I had to send them both back. After thinking why would 2 seperate laptops have the exact same problem, I figured it out, I had a contrast extension installed on my chrome web browser, and once i removed it both laptops were fine. So far thank you for a good purchase. HP 11 inch Chromebook is fast with quick bootup and is to easy to navigate with smooth touchpad. Setting adjustments tune Chromebook to your liking and with app store at a touch of an icon..many add on apps are available. 2 rear speakers give plenty of sound and wifi connection has not so far had any drop outs or lagging. Chromebook was given as Christmas gift but stayed in house hold so will see how performance is going foreward. I like the way HP does keyboards and touch pads, and this product lives up to my expectations. ChromeOS has come a long way since I last looked at it 5 years or so ago. This notebook has the ability to run Debian Linux in a chroot environment that has display access for GUI applications, which is an enormous plus for me. The MediaTek - MT8183 SoC runs very quickly and no lags or apparent memory shortage even with lots of tabs open. The wifi radios are killer, great speed and range. It works for my needs and is very user friendly. The seller was excellent. Very timely and arrived well before projected date. It\\'s not a big laptop but it has been a really good one my kids have took right to it for school work. Ive used it we haven\\'t had one bad thing to say about it and the price was awesome. Very good for myuse This is a glorified, oversized cell phone. Apps are okay but, I cannot print off this as there are no drivers for my printer. Also, limited on what you can do with any software and mouse pad. Save your money and just buy a laptop! It\\'s small and compact. The screen display I thought would be clearer. The battery life is great. I can use it for almost 4 days before putting it to charge. it\\'s just plain good. dependable. I bought this computer for schoolwork about a month ago ! and it works fabulous. Especially for the price 😀 I would definitely recommend Its great for my 13 yr old. Great price for what u get. It\\'s a good laptop it\\'s got an excellent price but figuring out how to work Chromebook is a bit sometimes beyond me Would be nice to have a larger keyboard and scree option. However, this gets the job done for what I need at the time. Great buy!!! Bought this for my son to use for the virtual school days and its almost perfect. We ran into a slight hiccup because there\\'s no windows button or caps lock key and he needs to know them for computer class. Otherwise its perfect for Google classroom. Does much more than I thought it would. Will not accept some apps. If you need a basic laptop to perform basic functions this is perfect. Super compact and simple to use. The cost is fantastic. Perfect for my simple needs. Purchased this for my mother to replace her 10 year old HP laptop that was beginning to decline. She loves it and finds it very easy to use, especially being in her 60s and not very tech-savvy. Everything is very good except for the sound quality. It is very low especially when I have a fan on. I use a speaker or loud headphones with it. Good for its price though! This device is way to restrictive for what it allows you to see or install. If you do not give google full access to all your information and locations it will not allow you to install some apps. Heck, it will not even show me a lot of apps to install. The laptop ok, but google has just put in to many road blocks to really make it useful. This is my home laptop. As I have a chrome book at work, I am used to using them and appreciate that they seem better protected from hackers than most laptops. If you want a fast, fairly lightweight laptop at a really low price, this is perfect. I use it for email, online shopping, bill pay, etc. It doesn\\'t have fancy bells and whistles but it\\'s exactly what I needed. The screen quality for me is bad, it would not and will not register certain colors and decides to make them either teal or blue. I can say the touch screen doesn\\'t work because while I didn\\'t know it was supposed to be toutch screen my family tried it and it never worked. Still the battery life is decently good. It can run most of the things I need, hut because of the problems listed above not as well as I would want/need. All in all with its problems it has and the few positives in comparison I give it two out of five stars. My older Chromebook was going to strip receiving updates last month so I needed to update my notebook. I couldn\\'t tell you how but while I was struggling with my printer and WiFi the Chromebook just magically downloaded everything from the old one too the new one. Like I said I don\\'t do \"tech\" the only thing is they were sitting on top of each other. 😁 I use this computer for my business everyday it is fast and the battery life is amazing I bought for 140$. It is a light, fast and great for laying in the bed 🙂. Very fast! This is about the 7th or 8th Chromebook in the family and happy so far. Was looking for something something kids could abuse and also suitable for semi-rough treatment at the beach, camping, etc. Also wanted excellent battery life, which this has (non-touch screen version), typically 11 hrs plus at about 80% brightness. Is very snappy with new processor. Screen isn\\'t the highest quality but better than expected at this price. All-plastic build, but very sturdy, and more compact than earlier models due to smaller bezels. And it gets updates until June, 2028. It\\'s very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.\\nPersonally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn\\'t get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use. Bought this to Homeschool my daughter and it works great. Pleasantly surprised by how great the battery on this chromebook is. I got it on a Saturday, charged it to full battery then the next charge was a week after! Granted I don’t use it often (just to go online for a bit and watch Disney+) but still that’s a great battery life! Highly recommend just for that alone lol. Plus easy interface and controls. An overall great buy on a Prime day 😬👍🏼 Easy to use and set up chromebook Work\\'s great, good picture! Awesome! Better than a laptop this chromebook is so fast and easy to use I bought this laptop after seeing that it has a Touchscreen but it does not . If anyone else wants a Touchscreen- stay away from this Laptop. The battery health is on point, there wasn\\'t anything that I disliked about it. The features are amazing. Loved this compact computer until out of no where it just stopped working. Won’t turn on. Sits at a desk in my office, no trauma, was on and working, stepped away, then it was off and would not turn back on. Pulled in, not a battery issue. The display is small and makes focusing on media for any prolonged period a difficult task. The processor is quick and efficient and pages load quickly. The sleek design offers and easy store and carry. It’s a get the job done chromebook without many luxuries. I didn\\'t realize how small it was however it\\'s a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that\\'s the only issue I\\'ve had with it took me awhile to figure it out but thanks to youtube , got it done..Very nice laptop This chromebook was perfect for my teens to do homework. Beautiful I owned this laptop for a month when it stopped working. After a few days of use, it started glitching and the screen would freeze multiple times a day. It would require needing to be restarted on a daily basis just so the laptop could become unfrozen. Assuming I may just had a bad computer, I reached out to the manufacture and they kindly offered to send a second laptop free of charge. The second laptop turned out to be worse than the first, however. After having that second laptop for less than a month it also stopped working. When looking at something with white in the web page, there would be what can best be described as blue scratch marks all over the screen. The company was nice, but I would not buy another chromebook from hp again. I previously owned a chromebook from Asus that cost half as much ($70 ish) but yet it lasted me 3 years. I wasn\\'t able to even get 1 month out of BOTH of my hp chromebooks.\\n\\nNow I bought the basic hp chromebook model without touchscreen. It is possible that the touchscreen version of this laptop avoids these issues. However, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks Easy setup and operation, price was competitive and overall a good buy. Is perfect This is perfect for what I need. I am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small. The USB spot on the side of the Laptop kept scratching my mouse and Flash drives and they would get stuck in there to the point it felt like if you were to pull it out with minimal strength it would snap. I provided an image im not sure if you guys can see it very well but there are 2 lines that were made from scratching on my flash drive. Not only that but this laptop was completely useless to me. it was recommended to me by an Amazon agent after telling him what i was looking for so i thought they couldn\\'t possibly get it wrong but i was incorrect. you can\\'t even download anything on this laptop unless its from the play store, it was the equivalent to my Samsung phone everything you could do on this you can do on a phone except a phone is better allows you to download certain files like \".exe\" which Chrome Operating systems don\\'t. If your looking for a chromebook to use the internet only then its perfect i experienced no lag with it but if you want more than that keep looking. Got replica Chromebooks that my kids use at school. Work great. Laptops worked great Wow arrived earlier than expected. Such a nice small laptop. Already enjoying it.. Came quick good quality I liked everything about the product the packaging the product . Everything came included there was no missing parts no nothing . You so t waste ya time buying this This laptop is pretty nice works good it isn’t touch screen but works perfectly for what i need it for screen quality is okay but no issues At first I liked I expected it to be a little bigger but it was small easy to carry and go on to go the touch screen never worked but I was okay with that the real problems came on like the 8th day after having it for one it does not charge unless it\\'s all even when powered off it barely charged I\\'d have it on the charger for over 5 hours to get on there and only have 20% the keyboard layout constantly changes on you to as though you\\'ll have constant problems with your password and will end up having to use guest mode I do not suggest this product at all Lightweight and sleek, great buy. The only good thing about this computer was its size and weight. Other then that it\\'s better to just get an AO2s which is about the same price but runs more programs. It doesn\\'t play any games and what it does has a smaller selection then the store on my Samsung phone. You can\\'t even jail break it to run Linux without really complex coding. And even then it\\'s highly iffy. Overall just get a smart phone and skip this PC. Works great. I currently use it for college, and this is definitely an affordable option for those looking for a high quality laptop. Thank you! The Chromebook is exactly what I needed and the shipping was super fast. Would recommend this purchase Perfect for watching movies, but wish the sound quality was better.\\nAlso great for work! Light, compact and battery lasts a long time! This version doesn’t have a touch screen. Worked well right out of the box. Great battery life Nice computer The keyboard is smaller than I prefer, but the functionality is perfect for my needs and budget. Fast Delivery, Great Laptop . Super Satisfied Does everything we need. Fast and efficient at a good price. Very happy with this purchase. Very light and too cheap for me. I returned it\\nI have another chromebook but the quality of this is subpar. No comment, but very useful. Nice, volume isn\\'t very loud but functions and speeds are sufficient.. Love my laptop very fast connection and beautiful video quality. Love it thank you good quality for price Not happy with this computer. Great price and arrived on time. However when I needed it to take my test to get my health and license license it was not compatible with their testing program. I missed my exam that day. Out of bucks. Have to retake it again and pay 60 more dollars. Highly frustrated. This was going to be my work computer but not anymore. This chromebook is not near the quality of my Acer chromebook. Popups are always coming up and the screen I\\'m viewing changes without any warning or reason. Also the screen is not nearly as sharply contrasting as the Acer. My advise is to not buy this piece of cheaply made junk. love it Love spending forever trying to download a chromebook recovery onto an old usb drive because it wouldn\\'t boot at all. New out of the box and everything. And of course customer service just tells you to contact the manufacturer. In all fairness, after I had returned it, I realized that it had been a refurbished item. I didn\\'t know that. The return was easy. Want a honest review? Don’t bother ordering the specs are not true and unless you just plan on going online to look at videos on YouTube I wouldn’t waste your time. This is not even a good starter laptop. You can’t run any type of software off here better off using your phone to go on YouTube. The speed is slow and mine wouldn’t even hold a battery charge. Returned it Whenever you turn it on there is a loud noise coming out of it not sure why that is I guess it\\'s ready to fall apart ordered two of these and both of them had green blotches on the screen saver and certain youtube videos This product was a Christmas present for my son. He was so excited to get it.Then come to find out it turns on but you can\\'t see the screen. Total bummer. It will Be returning. Don\\'t buy.. WASTE OF MONEY Received this product used. Previous owner had to remove the personalized name stickers but did not do a good job. The HP logo has tons of scratches. The track pad has scuff marks and the screen has a deep scratch. I did not even bother turning it on. RETURNING IT Had this computer for 6 months. Loved it. Screen went black and never started up again. Tried all the troubleshooter options. Just never came back on. It worked great at first. Then it quit working after a short time. Trash laptop the sound is running As described. Quick delivery. But we are an epidemic or pandemic sometimes it\\'s handy to zoom with family and friends and I have been able to use it as a research tool I love this Hp Chromebook 11a it is great and it is adorable 🥰 I absolutely love it it is great for work and school and games love it Chrome os and The laptop arrived earlier that expected. I order it Sept 7 and it arrived at Sept 15. The item is also in good condition. I will order again. Thank you I love it will b back Hard to beat. Most quality computer for the money. Would buy again. Perfect super great wrapped very good package and excellent my Baby boy loved his Christmas gift Very good 👍👍👍 For the price, it\\'s an exceptional computer. I enjoy the simplicity of it being a chromebook. I\\'m a writer and don\\'t require much. It provides me everything I need. The battery lasts quite awhile, the screen is great quality, and it\\'s perfect size/weight. This is a great device. We love it. Best purchase ! Affordable, easy access, screen quality I really can\\'t accurately rate this item - it was a gift delivered to my son in another state. What I can say it arrived quickly (next day) and son says it works good. Super for the use that is required. preparatory school Omg! Better than I thought. It is just right for me. It came before time and it works great must buy... Love this Chromebook. Easy to use, lightweight, and easily portable. Bought this to replace an old laptop. Since I\\'m retired, I didn\\'t need a lot of bells and whistles. This does everything I need it to do. Just be sure to check the compatibility list for printers on the HP Smart app before buying a new printer. Do not depend on the printer descriptions. I made that mistake. I got this Chromebook specifically for learning Spanish while traveling or while at work. It is durable and battery life is great. The size is great for travel and does everything I need for what Im using it for. Sound quality is good too. If you need to plug headphones in you can. My one beef with this laptop is the screen quality. More expesnive laptop 400+ tend to have a nice white screen with brightness. These chromebooks tend be made of cheaper material and have that horrid blue tint to them. Not a fan. The best price on the market There have been some recent notifications for those that own earlier Chromebooks that updates will discontinue as well as the suspension of the Google Web Store. if you have an earlier model, you can still use it but without Chromebook updates to the OS.\\n\\nThankfully, HP and others have release newer models that utilize SD memory better (when used with the standard memory in the Chromebook). This particular model will share the 32gb SD card memory with the Google Play Store apps as well as allowing the user to dedicate memory specific to the Linux development environment.\\n\\nIf you had an earlier Chromebook (configured in development mode) and used Crouton with xfce, you may have been disappointed with some of the quirks of the Linux desktop if you needed it for applications that weren\\'t available from Google (for your Chromebook) such as RealVNC for remote desktop applications. Thankfully, the model allow for more memory for the Linux applications. If you do choose to install the KDE desktop (I couldn\\'t get Crouton to work) make sure you allocate 10gb (rather than the suggested amount) since the KDE desktop loads up several apps you may not need including LibreOffice.\\n\\nThe KDE desktop is very flakey to use but this Chromebook has a separate section for Linux apps that can be executed without loading KDE first (without the need for learning a new GUI) since this model utilizes virtual memory better between the two operating systems.\\n\\nWhen installing RealVNC, this app has to be installed through KDE (using the .def file) through the terminal window. Once executed through KDE, the shortcut link to app resides in a the Linux app folder so that the separate Linux GUI no longer has to be executed first. It took me several hours to figure out the features but it is more reliable for hybrid work environments than the earlier generations used.\\n\\nIf you use Office, One Drive. or Nextcloud, these apps can be installed through the Google Play Store so that you can use them from your Chromebook as the app, rather than through the Chrome web browser (if you choose to do so).\\n\\nIf your phone doesn\\'t have enough room for gaming apps, no worries. Many of the gaming apps can be downloaded from Google Play and execute from the Chromebook.\\n\\nThe battery life does last for 15 hours and has better execution and performance than earlier models.\\n\\nLike most Chromebooks, it is lightweight and doesn\\'t need a great deal of cables plugged into it. It does work with Chromecast and is available as an option if the Chromebook sees any on the same network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis model works with OpenVPN too without file conversion by downloading the app from the Google Play Store and using the nonwindows config files to operate.\\n\\nI recommend using the USB 3.0, 1GB ethernet adapter from UGreen if you want to be a wired network. Those who live in tech areas like Seattle, the Bay Area, or the the Willamette Valley should know that the best security is wired internet to prevent any snooping over wi-fi.\\n\\nThere is no touchscreen on this model. I like how easy it is to use I bought this for my daughter due to the pandemic she had to use it for virtual school and it is amazing for price I will definitely purchase again for my other kids . Perfect for our kids when doing sch Another thing about this computer is you can download hundreds of Apps. There is an App for EVERYTHING!!\\nAlso the port for the mouse was a little bit tight so I had to use a bit of pressure to plug it in but it works just fine. This computer meets all my needs. I can do everything on it that I did on my laptop. The screen is great. I can use my mouse and my printer. I don\\'t play games on it. I can do word processing and spread sheets. It is very fast! It starts up in seconds and web pages load in seconds. I have no complaints! I love the waY it works and I love the way it do Nice little laptop for the price , I\\'m not very tech savvy but it works great for my streaming and stream labs , as well at twitch and Netflix etc.\\n\\nA small hiccup in shipping but contacted the seller at 3am and they got back to me at 5am??? Handled everything and we\\'re super professional and nice. Talk about costumer service\\n\\nCouldn\\'t be happier Bought this for my son\\'s 11th bday. So far, he loves it! The Graphics are beautiful!! Would recommend. Nice device.\\nBut beware!\\nOnly an American power connection for the socket is included and the keyboard is American, i.e. qwerty and not like the German qwertz.\\nThe device is therefore not so practical for children who need the device to learn. A very good device. I didn\\'t like the American power supply cable! Luckily I had a German ready. 🙂 works really well fast delivery arrived in excellent condition thank you Excellent for non-design, architecture or engineering students.\\n\\ncomplies to be able to study Very good laptop, it works 100% and looks and feels of quality. It is perfect for school work. The battery lasts approximately 10 to 11 hours. In terms of size, I don\\'t think it\\'s small but not big either, it\\'s very comfortable to use and perfect for working on word processors. It is a good option for basic and simple tasks as well as for social networks, very practical to take anywhere I arrive before the estimated date, perfectly packaged, it is practical, just what my daughter needed for her classes This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost. It’s a beautiful color and it has a clean look. My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it’s great for the price. I\\'m a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop \"work\" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.\\n\\nAbout the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the \"Windows 10-S.\" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to \"Windows 11 Home,\" which is more capable of evading corporate MS\\'s iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a matter of going into \"settings\" and changing it.\\n\\nI do not mind the PC and MS \"marriage\" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).\\n\\nAs far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.\\nMy overall opinion is \"nice.\" It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a \"tuck it in the bag and go\" type computer. Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn’t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose, and homework. The vaule is good for the money spent. The one we got is not touch screen. We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it, but I restart it and then have no problems after that. It is also good speed computer. We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well. Wasn’t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability (thank god), when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen. Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that’s what I’ve been using it for. I needed a PC just for internet browsing, email and the like.\\nFor just over $200 delivered, this PC fills the bill.\\nIt may be a refurb but mine looks like new - not a scratch or ding anywhere.\\nThere\\'s a camera, but no touchscreen.\\nThere\\'s Windows 11; it took about an hour to update the year-old build.\\nIt\\'s fast enough for my purposes.\\nAnd it looks good, too, not nearly as pink as in the pictures. This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials. The computer operates great and has no issues. Great product! Excellent product & touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop. The size is great, it’s in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this. And Pink! I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do. touch screen works perfectly. This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I\\'m very happy with it for the price. light weight, easy to use I\\'m very satisfied. Not a single scratch or issue. Beautiful color also. 😍 Very easy to use. Quite fast. Excellent for the money. For the price it\\'s a great deal I’ve had it for about two months. So far so good. I don’t use it for gaming or anything like that. Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media. I like the slim design of the HP Laptop.\\nIts very light, no extra battery to replace.\\nEasy to do work on, battery life is excellent so far.\\nScreen quality is great, sound quality is also very nice\\n\\nI love mine The laptop is light and very sleek. It doesn\\'t run slow. It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices. I play games sometimes and it doesn\\'t lag. FYI No this is not touch screen. The laptop came with the charger. Delivery was prompt, and the laptop was in excellent condition. It was very easy to set up. Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos, play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work. Great laptop and a terrific price. I am very pleased with my laptop. As functional as it is beautiful. exellent product good quality i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds! A great buy! I love the touch screen the most! Lol but overall great investment! The computer works just fine, but I cant activate Windows 11 due to no windows product key. Low cost. Works good. Would buy again. I received this laptop in great condition, however it didn\\'t come with a charging cable. My only option was to return the entire thing/get a replacement or buy a cord separately. I didn\\'t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included, and I saw other customer photos that included it. I\\'m annoyed that I\\'ll have to pay for one separately, or go through the hassle or returning and recording it. Love this computer. Work great! Love the color. I didn’t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised. Easy to start up walks you right through start up. Great price. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen. Turns out it was too good to be true. That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download, videos I watch, or updates I complete. They lied to most of us or they’re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color. It\\'s great. Better than my old one. Great for the money spent. Haven’t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home, and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though. I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too. Ive just received this laptop, and its already running like it has hundreds of viruses, slow af, cant enjoy any games, takes years to get to any website, I gave up on deleting the hundreds of apps that are pre installed, because how long it takes. if youre looking to get a good laptop, dont expect nothing good this cheap I guess. Nothing is able to be saved on this computer. I\\'m returning it.\\nRecommend DI NOT BUY. I love the color the screen looks great but it\\'s too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished.\\nVery upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already.\\n\\nWhile I was working, it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere ( see pics)\\nIt happened multiple times!\\nThis last time the screen wouldn\\'t come back, and I had to turn off and turn on again.\\n\\nNot reliable. I had it for a week only. I will be returning this.\\nI spent extra $100 and got a brand new one….\\n\\nToo risky! Easy set up and love the color Great purchase. Was a little scared at first to get but I’m happy I did. To replace a later hp laptop. Needed something smaller. More for ME!! Arrived like new. Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work , was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid. It is a great little laptop. I love finding these great buys in the refurbished/renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer. It doesn’t say it in the description. The comments made me think so. It came in perfect condition basically brand new. A little slow but very worth it! I’ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it’s literally a steel At first it was taking forever (3mins and a blank screen) to log in. I was ready to take it back. Then I tried to update and restart, then it started up right away. Hopefully this can handle my daughter\\'s first year of college! So far, not bad for price. The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor. Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer. 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, extra storage slot. Battery lasts a very long time. I have Windows 11...which works great!! I love it. It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer! This was a great buy. It’s a keeper for sure. Price can’t be bet. Great product.\\nThanks Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill. It came with Windows 11 which seemed to work well. Had no trouble with setup. It is lightweight and for a refurbished item. it looked brand new. My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming. It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine. It does not come with a CD/DVD player. I use flash drives to transfer data and programs. A 5 star buy. This doesn\\'t have touch screen on my model. The FHD display really surprised me. It\\'s better picture than a lot of these TVs. As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. As soon as the 33th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it\\'s got a burnt pixel. No way to fix that without replacing the screen. Unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. HP is still shady in that regard. I fully upgraded the machine when I got it. 16GB ram, 1TB Samsung 980 SSD. The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. I have a Geforce 980, an octocore AMD CPU, and 24GB DDR3 ram in my tower. This laptop of course has a little less RAM, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. I really am surprised at this. The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 CM gap. There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just isn\\'t room. They couldn\\'t even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. I had problems with HP in the past, they screwed up a laptop return I sent in, then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures, so I\\'m not shocked at how they treat customers. I swore I\\'d not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up. It\\'s super light weight. The camera is nothing fancy, in Windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. It\\'s instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool. Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. You\\'ll also want to get a good set of headphones. The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out. The machine simply wasn\\'t designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. When you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you\\'ll find it\\'s incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI. It forces you to keep the screen open, which isn\\'t good to have static screens. I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there isn\\'t anything I can do about it. It isn\\'t that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. I have a warranty but again, it\\'s not going to cover this damage, so I spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen. The case is the cheapest plastic they could find. Given this was produced during the pandemic you\\'re left with another problem. Check your RAM speeds. If you get stuck with a 1R16 chip you\\'re basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2R8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. They don\\'t mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you\\'ll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. Overall, I probably wouldn\\'t buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. It\\'s just too poorly designed. I give it a year or two before it fails. Most likely, knowing HP it will be 26 minutes after the OEM warranty expires. They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it\\'s been nearly 8 years since I swore I wouldn\\'t buy another one, they changed; for the worse. So this was the first non high-end gaming laptop I\\'ve ever purchased, with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school, work, and general basic use. To be quite honest, it\\'s surprisingly nice! After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a 15\" display from my previous 17\", the screen is of good quality. The processing speed is not disappointing at all. The sound is great (it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that). I don\\'t find Windows 11 to be offensive to use. Keyboard is friendly. It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality (not super cheap feeling). It\\'s light to carry. Loads videos and webpages quickly. No crashing or general use issues as of yet. I\\'ve even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it\\'s running just fine. I\\'m really pleasantly surprised. And coming from someone who is used to a 5k+ Alienware Gaming Laptop (aka me), the fact that I don\\'t hate this thing is truly impressive enough. If you pressed me to find something I don\\'t love about it, I\\'d say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh. It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying. But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work, I plugged it in and hit the power button, only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it. So I am not even mad. No touch screen on my model. And I can\\'t attest to it\\'s gaming abilities because, well, I have an Alienware for that. Seriously though, best spent $400 ever. Ok so overall this laptop is a decent, practical, all-around laptop. Not great, but good enough. If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better.\\n\\nIf you’re like me, don’t have time to scout the internet, and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation, then it’s possible at some point you’re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you’ll accept only being reasonably happy with it (aka I settled).\\n\\nHere is my observation of each aspect of the laptop:\\n* The screen quality is good, but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough, so I’m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment.\\n\\n* The battery life is ok, lasting me about 7 hours currently. We will see how long that keeps up, as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about 1-2 years.\\n\\n* The keys feel good to type on, which I was relieved to find.\\n\\n* The speed of the laptop is only alright. For an SSD, I expected it to be faster. This machine will stream video just fine, but don’t plan on doing any video editing or gaming.\\n\\n* The weight is actually very nice, but that should be expected with such a small screen.\\n\\n* One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot, which I like. Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan, but this computer does not need that. I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm.\\n\\n* Lastly, and unfortunately, the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable. At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings. But after doing so, I realized it is not a software issue.\\n\\nThe problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough. So in effect, what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad. That is fine when you’re moving the cursor large distances across the screen, but it means that fine, small movements are difficult to achieve. It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this.\\n\\nLuckily, I came up with a solution. You will need to order a touchpad cover / skin for $10. They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones. It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface. This worked well. The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop, so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size.\\n\\nHere are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks:\\n\\nFix screen settings:\\nright click on the desktop > show more options > AMD radeon software > display > reduce contrast to 94 > increase the brightness to 25\\n\\nFix touchpad by searching for this on amazon:\\n\\nCaseBuy MacBook Air 13 Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skin\\n\\ncut it down to size and install it\\n\\n(make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don’t have any bubbles in it after you’re done)\\n\\nAfter you’re done installing it, you’ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity.\\n\\nGo to:\\nWindows settings > bluetooth & devices > touchpad > taps > touchpad sensitivity > high sensitivity\\n\\nThat’s all I’ve got. Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it. Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them. I like how lightweight it is, the ram is upgradeable & so is the SSD drive! I have always been partial to HP; my last 4 computers have been HP\\'s. I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too. It drains the battery faster than I would like, but it could be my settings, I will keep you all posted. Thank you, Amazon!!!\\nAdditional Findings! A month in and this is what I discovered: When I ordered this laptop, I had two things in mind. # One is a backup computer for my desktop, I use it for my entertainment system, it is partly a backup Plex Server. It works great by the way. # Two I wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to a coffee shop and do whatever, as I enjoy my coffee outdoors. No complaints so far. I have since tweaked my battery settings and have literally increased my battery life by about 3 times between recharges. Go to YouTube and look up how to extend battery life on an HP Laptop and you will find helpful tips. I have no heat problem what so ever (some people have complained about that.) I upgraded the memory to 16 gigs and it is fast as all get out. So, hence my rating stays a 5 star! Keep in mind it is made of plastic, be gentle, if you wish to upgrade on your own, don\\'t be a bull in a China shop. Yes, before you ask, you can hook it up to a large monitor and close the lid, it is in Windows settings, when in doubt YouTube is my go-to. I hope this helps I am happy to answer questions, if I can. Understand what you are buying and how you want to use the product and have fun! This laptop did surprise me. The Ryzen 5 mobile CPU is rather good and the 8GB of RAM that it comes with is more than sufficient if you only plan on doing simple tasks - office work, watching videos on video websites, etc.\\n\\nI was surprised to see next to no bloatware on my machine, though this could be due to the fact they do only give you a 256GB SSD. There is an expansion slot for a SD/Micro SD card, but the laptop does have an additional slot for another stick of RAM and you can swap out the included SSD with an upgraded one, provided you know how to do it or know someone that can do it.\\n\\nIf you upgrade to 16GB of RAM for dual channel mode and get a high performant SSD, then you get a lot more performance since Ryzen processors often work better with dual channel memory. This is essential if you want to do any medium gaming on this laptop. I upgraded mine and I love it even more. this is a good cheap laptop for doing various activities, however gaming is a very poor experience on this laptop. i dont know why it is marketed for gaming, as it can barely hit 30 frames at 1080 on most games. i assume you could run some very light indie games or super well optimised games on it, but anything that requires any kind of gpu power, forget about it. i will still give 5 stars tho because it does everything i need it to and does it well. good battery life i usually get at least 5 hours of use out of it per charge. Needed a new laptop and this was just what I needed. Easy to set up and it loads quickly. Excellent performance for daily tasks, banks, online procedures, downloading and editing files, etc. Great contribution of bluetooth connectivity, excellent wifi speed. Very fast in everything. Great price for this purchase. Satisfied customer Excellent team! Practically everything they offer however does not have the Backlit keyboard as it says in the features for sale. (They should take care of that detail), for the rest, it is very fast, I love the screen, excellent quality and the battery lasts a long time If you plan on using this outside it may not be bright enough. Bought this laptop specifically for school. It’s great and not so big that it doesn’t fit on my desk that holds my work stuff. This computer seems to work fine. I thought from the photos it had an SD card reader, but it just has a slot for one so I have to use a separate card reader. The AMD Ryzen 5 chip gives this laptop great performance and battery life. Both the CPU and especially the built-in GPU perform very well. Also, it really doesn\\'t get hot nor draw much battery during operation. A very good performing inexpensive laptop overall. I bought this for my Nephew. He likes it a lot, but he is a writer and he had to install and pay for a word program. I don\\'t know why laptops don\\'t offer something simple for writing purposes. Other than that, he is pleased with the laptop. I’m very happy with this laptop, I’ve had it like 2 weeks now and I’ve used it every single day. It arrived very quickly. It’s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs, homework, web browsing, to even some gaming. I’ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested, but even just with the 8gb I’ve been able to run some lower spec games. Games like Sims 3/4/city, Bethesda games, age of empires, ALMOST everything I’ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles. Whether you’re looking for a cheaper option for playing games (don’t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings), a school laptop, or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on, this is a good contender for the price. The only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars are; the external hardware is nothing fancy, not bad quality just could be better, the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast, and the material the track pad is made of is not that great. Other than that, I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop.\\n\\nEDIT: I have had it for like 4 months now. I still love it and all of this still remains true. I have played some better games on it as well, such as Ready or Not and Arma 3. Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions. Arma 3 runs like a charm 85% of the time. In single player you van even run on ultra graphics for an FPS trade off. I run the CPU pretty hard sometimes and it does pretty well at keeping up. The pannatalle brought a detail. A bright spot that is noticeable when the background is dark. The battery doesn\\'t last more than four hours and it has a problem that, I think is a configuration problem, that doesn\\'t let me place the accent. I make the language adjustments, I restart it and everything is fine. After two minutes, it returns with the same problem. I feel disappointed. I don\\'t know how to request a change, because I bought it from Venezuela. I bought this for my granddaughter who is a Sophomore in high school because she is taking computer graphics courses. She really likes it. All good This is a great computer for the value and I am happy with the purchase but, when the computer arrived, it was missing the 3 prong connector jack for the plug to outlet. Please take note as I had to wait another two days and purchase this part. I bought this laptop for my kids so they could do homework and it works really good. No issues so far. Pretty quick Exactly what I expected. Perfect size and power for what I need. Good looking unit too. Seller was very accommodating too. For what it is, it\\'s pretty good, a ryzen 5 with an SSD and a fhd screen for 400 is honestly impressive. I hate the fact that windows 11 was installed by default, so I moved to Fedora Linux as soon as I was to. I haven\\'t tried any gaming, but I can confidently say it won\\'t run much. Definitely a better choice than a chromebook. This may be the best option available for less than $500 as of February 2022. It has decent battery life (7-8 hours), good performance, it’s portable, and upgradable (if you are skilled & careful). Perfect for a student or for business use. You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse, office work, watch movies, etc. Be prepared to deal with Windows 11 (sigh) and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU’s and Windows brilliant fan control… Overall, I recommend it. I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads. However, I am familiar with upgrading and repairs. This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding. I’m happy thus far! My only gripe is the screen. The refresh rate is noticeably low with media viewing (Netflix). HP has a home run with the average, non gaming user. Just wanted a quick boot up and won’t burn my legs laptop at a reasonable price. Rips through all my programs with ease. I am very satisfied. I bought this for general use, as well as photo editing. I know there are more robust laptops and PC’s out there, but I didn’t want to spend a ton. This laptop is very good for the price. It starts up quickly and handles apps with no problems. I do not play games on it, so I cannot tell you how it runs those. I do have Lightroom and Photoshop on it and it handled those very well out of the box. I did, however, add 8GB of RAM to the laptop and Lightroom and Photoshop do REALLY well now. No issues whatsoever. I didn’t know how I’d feel about the Ryzen processor, but it does a fabulous job. With the added memory, I don’t think there’s anything this laptop won’t handle.\\n\\n*Note. If you are going to add RAM to this laptop, BEWARE. You have to remove the entire bottom panel including removing the glued on grip pads. When you remove these, they may or may not come off cleanly, meaning they may not go back on the way they were without some glue or repair. Just be extremely careful in removing them. Easy to travel with. Fast processor. I loved everything about this laptop. It was great until I went to turn it on the other day and though the light indicating it was starting up went on, it quickly went off and it has not worked since. Since it is a laptop, I was advised it would be cheaper to buy a new one rather than fix this one. Very disappointed! Good specs for this mid-level laptop. Perfect for my kid heading off to college. It has all that is needed except maybe an additional upgrade in RAM needed in the next year or two. I never really take my laptop anywhere so I never really rely on it for on the go, I’ve bought this so I can run emulators on my laptop and the limit of this pc seems to be The ps3 emulator, so everything before it should run fine. That’s for people that care about that but overall a solid Investment for me It\\'s a basic laptop that you can use for work. Comes with Windows 11 and you then buy Office. It\\'s really lightweight - almost exactly as light as the MacBook Air. So if you don\\'t want to spend a lot on a laptop and you only use it for basic stuff like Office, YouTube and web surfing and you are not too finicky about specs then it\\'s a great choice. The AMD Ryzen is pretty fast - kinda faster than Intel IMO. We needed a computer that was light and portable for school. This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for, and we bought it and a additional stick of ram. It works well, performance is plenty.\\n\\nBut the. Negative, and why it doesn\\'t get. 5 stars. The feet are small starving it for air, even when raising it, the fan loves to spin up, way too loud and waay to often. A laptop cooler rectified this issue but for a low power laptop, not impressed with the cooling. Screens OK, nothing special, which that\\'s this laptop top to bottom, OK, nothing special. I\\'d definitely but another, but I might pull apart and check the thermal compound, put some higher quality compound on it, and see if it helps. I gifted this for my daughter who is a gamer and builder. Add another compatible 8GB 3200 RAM (about $40) and upgrade to a fast 1TB-2TB NVMe SSD ($60-$200). I play Fallout4 with a mix of med to mostly high settings with no lag. I wish the keys lit up. The whole keyboard seems rickety and not very sturdy. It will do for now but I regret not buying another MacBook. I ended up returning it because it doesn’t have an ethernet port. I didn’t know that not all computers have one. It seemed like it would be a great computer for a casual user. My grand son picked it out. As suits well for UTC Its good for basic gaming but anything like vr or final fantasy will not be playable unless you take out the entire motherboard and get a new one so you might as well get a better more expensive laptop because thats gonna cost about the same My son wanted a gaming laptop for his birthday. He enjoys Minecraft, Roblox, and some Steam games. I didn’t want to invest in a laptop built specifically for gaming quite yet, but this had specs that I felt would work for his interests. I also followed a reviewer’s advice and instructions (by the way, that review deserves a gold medal) to acquire and install another stick of RAM to bring it up to 16g. Not gonna lie, I narrowly avoided a heart attack while removing the bottom plate of the laptop, but it really was a pretty easy process to give an upgrade that lets my son play the heavier Steam games without lag. He is very happy, and so is my wallet! The equipment arrived in good condition and performs 100 I wanted to give this Laptop 5 starts but the battery life is no good. In just 20 mins I lose 10% battery power even when it runs on balanced. Overall a great and powerful little computer. Lightweight and excellent screen quality. Do I recommend buying? Yes. I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows 11 as my desktop could not be upgraded. So far for the budget price it was a good choice, so I\\'m not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel. It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows 11. My opinion on Win 11 is still out. It\\'s not touch screen but other then that decent and fast Good value for money, works as described. Good fast delivery. I do shirt design and am a college student so I definitely use my computer a lot, this computer functions well and is pretty fast. The battery last me maybe 6 hours and is very lightweight. Speedy and powerful, I can finally play Genshin Impact. Great battery life and fast to update with a lot of storage. The internet reception isn\\'t very good on it though. i had this laptop for few months.\\nlet me tell you. this laptop is the best bang for the buck. when i first got it, it had everything i needed in a laptop. I got it for the main purpose to use it on the go when i am not at the office.\\nhowever, after few months, i started noticing that every time i turned it on, the battery is dead. which makes the laptop unusable, especially for the purpose i got it for.\\nthis week, i made sure to charge it to 100% and turned it off, so it is ready to be used when i needed it in case of emergency.\\nto my surprise, when i turned it on after few days, the battery was at 0% completely drained, while the laptop was off. Best priced laptop. AMAZING battery life and quick charge. You get everything you want in a simple but powerful computer without having to pay for the \"premium\" of a top brand name, or the \"premium\" of an Intel Chip. Thing works just fine -- one glitch is I have to often restart my laptop (takes like 30 seconds max) to initially connect to my WiFi ... maybe an easy fix?\\n\\nI\\'d recommend this laptop - I just want to know how to fix the reboot issue. Highly recommend! My son has been begging for a laptop for gaming and has a bday coming up (big 12). This laptop has good specs and we upgraded the ram to 16gb (up to 32gb). The hard drive can be upgraded (up to 2tb). The price is budget friendly. This laptop runs steam and GTA 5 without issues. The only problem I have is that the processing is not as good with windows 11, the rest of the PC is fine it\\'s light it\\'s ryzen 5. I do realize that I needed a graphic card though I got this for school as an online college student and I love it!... So far. I\\'ve only had it a few days but it works great! It runs fast, I love that the keys are big and don\\'t on them. It\\'s lightweight and the screen is a good size. All and all I\\'m very pleased. Pro: quick, seems well built for the price, value for money\\n\\nCons: no fingerprint reader (I assume the IR camera replaces this, but not my liking), dim screen, need to add extra stick of 8GB RAM to get all the performance off the CPU The idle cpu was quite high when I first got it. Still is even after some tweaking. perfect screen and my games work fine Produst was as expected but I ordered 2 laptops and only one came with shipment. Had to find out why and apparently warehouse only had one but there was no communication so 1 daughter happy and other disappointed as we had to order a different one from another seller.\\nRefund was quick though. Bought this to replace my last HP laptop that died. So far, I\\'m impressed. I am very pleased with this laptop, overall. I opted for the Windows 11 version and find it to be what I wanted in this type of computer.\\n\\nI find the lack in number of USB ports to be a downer, but a quality USB hub (I use UGREEN products) will fix that shortfall. I am adding additional memory to the unit, my folly ...\\n\\nRecommend! Excellent quality price. Really good specs for a laptop. I did purchase another stick of 8 gb ram, not too bad to install, just be patient when removing bottom panel. Cinebench score of 5299, which for a mobile processor is not bad. Plan on using with an external monitor, external keyboard, external mouse for CPA/business/tax work. Cheaper than buying a small form factor desktop. Bought this for simple audio recording and it is amazing for that. It is very snappy out of the box, but I did upgrade it with another 8 gig stick of ram for future proofing. I would wholly suggest it for any type of workstation duties. Everything came fine, box was sealed and undamaged but when it was opened I notice this huge scratches at the back. Somewhat displeased because I know this is a new system but now it feels like a used device So far I have had no problems. The speed is good. I have a second memory card that I haven\\'t installed yet, but will soon. As fast as it is now, I can only imagine how much better it will be. Will give another update later. I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer. My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen. I\\'d be lying if I said I don\\'t miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake, I thought it was a touchscreen, it is not. It\\'s a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for. So far so good. Very sleek and light weight. Love it Thanks Touch screen nice Just the right stuff for home and student. This laptop is really good and fast. I just upgraded the ram 8gb to 16gb crucial ram and also 1tb sss crucial. Now this thing is butter. Good to buy I had doubts about the AMD processor, used to Intel for a long time but it is super fast, the battery lasts several hours. It is not touch but the colors of the screen are great. It comes with Windows 11 Great laptop for going back to school exactly what you need for a reasonable price! I tried to like this laptop, I love how lightweight it is and the screen is pretty good, it gets bright enough. The CPU is also very fast for everyday use and streaming videos. However, there are two issues I have encountered. One, the wifi reception is very poor, I have another Lenovo Legion laptop that gets full wifi signal anywhere in the house even far away from the modem, while this HP laptop gets very very weak signal if I am moderately far from the modem. second issue, this laptop gets too hot, even while doing relatively minor tasks, but the problem gets worse while it\\'s plugged in, the fans go crazy and both the laptop and the AC adapter overheat. Overall I wouldn\\'t recommend this laptop. Battery life not as long as stated. Laptop feels cheaper made thany last laptop. Screen quality seems good. Fast processor, quality in materials, well built!! Had a HP 15\" laptop and this one lacks some features but is smaller and lighter weight. good display and keyboard. As for as a laptop, that is all it is. The headphone jack stopped working after 3 months. The battery is meh, it drains pretty quickly if the laptop is off or in sleep. It takes forever to turn on, I legitimately thought it was broken when I first received it because of that. It also takes forever to come out of sleep. The review mentioned a touch screen, I don\\'t think it has one. If it does, mine does not work. It was amazing I loved how fast it was to set up a very cheap laptop for gaming Everything is good. Really like it Very useful and maneuverable equipment, comfortable to work Love it! Very satisfied😊 This laptop is amazing! As you can see in the image, the screen presents this problem and it is more visible when the background is white or light, I have not used a lot this laptop and it started to present this problem for some reason. This computer is complete TRAAASH! Don’t walk RUN! Keeps restarting and black screen every 2 mins. DO NOT RECOMMEND! HP needs to do better with their products! This computer literally disconnects it\\'s self from the internet every 1-3 minutes and I\\'m not even exaggerating. In a 24 hour day I experienced 30 minutes of solid fast internet, the rest of the time is just slow, constantly buffering, disconnecting and reconnecting. I\\'ve tried everything, updated everything, made sure no power saver is turning it off, no metal is near the laptop and after extensive research I can\\'t get anything close to answer because all the answers provided don\\'t actually work. I can\\'t even check my email without it disconnecting 5 times. Trash, absolute trash and I\\'m certainly returning this worthless computer because what good is a computer for streaming if it can\\'t stay connected. Got this. Working fine for a few weeks. But then I started getting the blue-screen-of-death-2022.\\n\\nGot a replacement computer through the great assistance from Prime-Member\\'s-customer-support. Got the replacement today and brand-new, but during the setup I got that same blue screen message.\\n\\nMoving on and away from HP and non-Intel-processors for a while. Computer worked great then went to open it up and turn it on and it doesn’t work! 55 days old. the battery won\\'t charge to full The laptop is fine but I\\'m deducting a star because the keyboard is not backlit. I own three very similar HP latptops purchased through Costco over the past two years. The Costco laptops were Intel powered i3 and i5 machines with the same 250 nits 14\" FHD screens, SSDs and backlit keyboards. This unit is very similar however it is AMD powered and the keyboard is not backlit. I tried my best to ensure that it was however I could not confirm on the web. So let me be the first to confirm it is not. I needed a smaller computer. My desktop took up too much space on my desk while working from home. This laptop has been great. I can put it away when not being used and put it in my bag and take it with me when traveling for work. I would buy it again. This was purchased for my daughter and she LOVES IT!\\nFast, and great features.\\nThanks! I’m glad I tried this laptop. It gave me an appreciation for my 5-year-old model that has more speed and memory. I returned it knowing that I should buy at least an equivalent replacement. I’m not a gamer and\\nI have spent hours fixing touch screen problems. I bought it because it came without a touch screen and without enough gaming power. I was looking for updated features, but didn’t find any. Pretty much the same ol’ wrapped in pretty Windows 11 screens. The price was perfect for the quality. The narrow-margin anti-glare screen is beautiful. The camera doesn’t support the Windows “hello” feature. Start up is much slower than I expected. Without the experience of higher-end machines, this is a great choice. Good deal This is the first time I used an AMD processor, and I’m pleased. Works great! Love the light weight and awesome quality! Better than dell Not a gaming laptop, but that\\'s not how it\\'s sold. Great for school and light work. Got this for my daughter after all of the chromebooks in the house died. It\\'s the perfect size/weight, and has enough spec to run all of her games and schoolwork. She loves it! Good After seeing so many rough reviews I was a bit skeptical myself, but no worries this laptop is lovely! I\\'m months in and currently typing up this review on it. The keyboard is fantastic and satisfying. The mousepad is super responsive and has even a left and right side that have different features. Although the screen is not my favorite it still works well. This computer performs magically, but I do recommend installing extra ram onto this to rock its full potential. Overall beastly computer, take my word for it! It is a very good quality-price option, with respect to the competition in laptops, I was comparing many and this was undoubtedly the best. As for the equipment, it is a good assembly, it arrived without problems and very well packaged. The only thing that I could point out is that it gets quite hot and it could be uncomfortable to have it on your legs for example after a while. It is exactly as described, very fast, very light easy to transport, very good resolution. I met my expectations. It is a good lap it has a ryzen 5 5500U for the price you are not going to find something better, it has 8GB of ram which is single channel so with one more module you do dual channel the only downside I can give it is the brightness level of the screen outdoors and that the battery lasts, but fair enough, it\\'s a good lap for the price you\\'re not going to find something better. I bought it for about 11,800 in early March I\\'ve only had this laptop a couple of days, but I really like it. I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior. The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide. This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case. The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop. Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop.\\nOk a little update. I do like this laptop a lot. I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn\\'t work right out of the box. I\\'m dumbfounded by these reviews. The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself.\\nThis device had a defective battery out of the box. I didn\\'t notice that until after a few days. I contacted H P and they were great to work with. They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good. H P offered to replace the battery free, but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery. I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop. They weren\\'t game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it. Well, being the kind of person I am, I went to my favorite retailer, Amazon, ordered the proper battery, replaced the dead one and now I have a great laptop with a good battery. I would still give it a 5 star review and recommend it to anyone. This is a great improvement over my ancient Dell D800. Because it runs Microsoft Windows as the operating system, the laptop requires about three minutes to start all of the basic services and processes before one can reasonably use it.\\n\\nOne issue: when plugging in a USB thumb drive, the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse did not function properly. I purchased a powered USB hub to resolve this issue.\\n\\nThis laptop is being used by me for DAW (Digital Audio Workshop), with vocal recording for my music. I also use it for video editing and rendering. For my other computer needs, I still use the Dell. I\\'ve been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference. This is the fastest one I\\'ve ever owned. I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books. This notebook is too great to use for just that. Can\\'t say enough good things about it. This isn\\'t compatible with the pricey HP Thunderbolt G2 dock. Not sure why a chromebook is but HP to HP won\\'t. Also I bought this Amazon used and the warranty was activated and only had 4 months left. Product itself seems nice though. i truly like. did have one issue when starting to downloads origin for Sims but i found a forum from EA and fixed it\\nIt should’ve already been installed and up to date as a gamer pc however, it was used and i think cleared so anyway, it was easy to fix once i researched I bought this for my private practice and it works great. Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office. Analogue: Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it\\'s not a new iPhone. I am very happy with it. It runs faster than I expected, which was my biggest concern. Very pleased with this product. Wife has no complaints and computer functions quite well. Great price! Is a good pc to work and watching movies but not for playing games Nice laptop, works as expected. It forgets the internet easily, if you leave your location and come back- so keep your eye out for that. Other than that there is not much to complain about. I was expecting something more mettalic heavy, but feels like a Asus talking about the body. Otherwise performance is good. Feels smooth and responsive. I\\'ve got the issue with the WiFi driver and Windows 11 but fixed looking and searching on the web. HP support didn\\'t help me at all.\\nI didn\\'t like that the keyboard is not backlight.\\nAlso it gets very overheated fast. All our programs are cloud hosted so we didn\\'t need anything super powerful. This laptop is actually overkill for accessing our web based program and Microsoft 365 but we bought these for longevity over any i3. The i3 models just don\\'t last as long and tend to get slow much sooner than this i5 model. Dozens purchased, no issues so far. I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing. I believe that the \"bloatware\" was interfering with it. I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail. It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging). I am now completely satisfied. I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the \\'no wifi\\' reviews; I actually thought that \\'I wont get one of those\\', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi, they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident. Honestly, I know absolutely NOTHING about computers. I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like 2007 that didn\\'t even connect to the internet. In senior year of high school we had chrome books, and those were so simple to use. When I got this computer, it was intimidating and I struggled to figure it out. BUT even without support of microsoft amazon or hp I was able to fix the error code myself. The screen display is beautiful, bright, and perfect for me. I can\\'t wait to see how it does for my college courses and sims! I recommend it. It\\'s a perfect size, and VERY sleek girllllll (or guy I won\\'t discriminate lol)! I don\\'t do a lot of gaming, but it\\'s great for Microsoft 365, email and shopping. The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are. Until I learned where the \\'end\\' key was, for instance, I struggled to see it. Still it\\'s a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it. Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only 2 months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back - occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time…. This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi- this needs to be addressed I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck 🚛 deal. I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless. I have had no such issues nor any other issues. Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally. I find I never have to wait on it to do anything. It boots up faster than any previous PC I\\'ve had. Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost. Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it! I use this HP Laptop for personal use as well as for my Prayer Group duties. I maintain membership lists as well as other related lists. I create ads for our events and send them via email to our rectory for insertion in the church\\'s bulletin. Our other HP Laptop has been in use for these purposes since 2016. Since my husband has been using the other laptop more frequently, (writing novels), I decided to get one for myself. This way I have access whenever I want it. I fully expect this Laptop to serve me as well as the older one did. LOL to the one-star reviews from people who can\\'t connect to Wi-Fi or used to some other brand and can\\'t figure out HP. It\\'s a computer! You have to either know how to use it, learn how to use it, or buy support. I\\'ve had this computer for 5 months and yes, yesterday I couldn\\'t connect to Wi-Fi. Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty. (I didn\\'t.) Started reading the reviews. But then I tried figuring out why my Wi-Fi isn\\'t connecting (via my cell phone). It took a while, I learned a lot of computer innards, and after successfully connecting to Wi-Fi, I\\'m typing this review from it. Wi-Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop. The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program.\\nThis laptop is great! Superfast! Pages load instantly - something I wasn\\'t used to with my previous laptops. Plenty of space for all my \"stuff\" in the form of photos, videos, family trees, and also my husband\\'s business programs, logs, documents and files. I\\'m very happy we bought it, so therefore 5-star review. Excellent performance. My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me. That said, I bought it for my children to use, so might not be a problem. equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price. Picked this up for my 85 year old dad. Very fast machine, nice and light. Trackpad clicking isnt as smooth as more expensive machines and keyboard feel is just ok. Would totally get again if on sale. When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.\\n\\nFirst, the cons:\\nIs it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn\\'t intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don\\'t buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn\\'t the brightest. The sound quality isn\\'t immersive. There is no optical drive.\\n\\nNow, the pros:\\nThe price. This is a 15\" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn\\'t for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn\\'t super speedy, but it isn\\'t unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn\\'t buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.\\n\\nWho should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.\\n\\n[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn\\'t?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.] Great For this price this laptop is amazing. I use this for gaming and college and it runs great. Very durable and can run bigger games like sims and castlevania. its light weight, and the keys are large and easy to press, comes with windows installed and its a fast booter and runs smooth, perfect and will do the job Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task. The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn\\'t hold a charge longer than 10 minutes. After five months the laptop won\\'t work unless plugged in. HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse. Laptop looks new! No scratches or marks.\\n\\nRuns smoothly after three months. I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse! This is feedback from my Daughter who I had it sent to as a gift. HP is typically good equipment. The components and spec in the AD appear to be a solid unit for it\\'s intended purpose. I\\'ll send an update upon hearing further information. I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school. I needed something quickly, but I wanted quality. I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes. I am so happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze, it took maybe 5 minutes, and maybe an extra 5 for the updates. The picture is crisp and clear, it has great sound, the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read. I purchased the windows 11 version and have no regrets. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in. With the exception of heavy gaming, I can\\'t imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn\\'t be able to do for work or for school. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it. I just needed a computer for home use and this one fit the bill. I bought it refurbished and I couldn\\'t be happier. Perfect condition and no issues. It is light, easy to use and install. She bought it for my daughter for college and she loves it. Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for. Works well with Teams, video quality is ok, but I\\'m not using it for gaming. Only 1 HMDI port- which is kind of annoying when you\\'d like to connect it to multiple monitors. Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi- which is inconvenient (to put it mildly) when you need to be online for work. Other than that it\\'s an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it\\'s supposed to. It is ideal for my step-daughter\\'s on line tutoring. She absolutely loves it. Perfect for my needs. Got as a \"deal\"... great value. Would definitely buy again. It’s nice. Had issues w it not staying connected to the WiFi though. Had to tamper w the bios to get it to finally work. Computer works well and seems a good value. Enjoy Windows 11. Had one glitch when it dropped internet and struggled to get reconnected. Thought we might have either software or hardware issue. Did finally get it back, but normally it would be an easy reconnect just by finding a viable WiFi signal. Not the case. If it occurs again, we’ll deal with HP to see if we have a hardware issue; reason for a 4-star rating. Otherwise, it was easy to set up and connect with printer and monitor. And, it’s really lightweight so easy to travel with in my backpack. I purchased this to replace my 13 year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing, social media, emailing, photo retouching, and Word/powerpoint/excel projects.\\n\\nThis HP is everything I needed, and more! Windows 11 is much more user-friendly than Windows 10. The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal. It starts up quick, and holds a charge for at least 8 hours.\\nBest of all, it\\'s lightweight and thin, so traveling is a breeze.\\n\\nBonus: it is bluetooth compatible, so I can make/answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room.\\nAnother bonus: numeric keypad!\\n\\nThe only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back-lit keyboard, but I\\'m not sweating the small stuff. i love the SSD and the I5. not too crazy about windows 11. Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos.exe. But, I love the computer, especially the boot time (<10 seconds) We bought this computer to replace one that was \"irredeemable\". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3. I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better. The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day. This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it. The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails. The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support. We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year. (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft \"updated\" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they \"updated\" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. At that point I was loud and angry. I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware. \"You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it\". I said I would not pay such ransom ware money. I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the \"automatic update button\". I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.) An update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack. I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. If I don\\'t receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. If that doesn\\'t work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.) Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back. I hope I remember the name \"Tech Deals Store\" and never buy from these people again. I don’t have any issue with the screen display and no issue connecting to Microsoft account and store. It worked right out of the box! I just have to set up some things before the first use.The keyboard could have a backlit display for use at night time tho! The keyboard itself is a little bit confusing because it has so many buttons that are unnecessary, people don’t use that much of extra things that’s on this keyboard. The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho! I am happy with it. I don’t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube. I don’t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram, but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it’s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience. Everyone has their own preference! The only suggestion I have is to buy your laptop directly from Amazon not from marketplace sellers! If you need to customize your laptop specifications I suggest you buy from bestbuy and from the manufacturers. Happy shopping 🛍😊 Pro:\\nGood price. Nice size، easy to handle ، light weight ، good battery life\\nCon:\\nDull screen. Not enough brightnrss. If I knew this is how the screen is going to look, I would have not purched this laptop. This laptop is very responsive, very fast. i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy, I find it sturdy. The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop. Other wise, a very good laptop. My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I\\'m working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I\\'m able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I\\'m able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints. Let me preface this by saying, I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers. Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews. I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review. Overall, I’m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it! I am still experimenting with this little girl, but I am very pleased. I do not game, so didn\\'t enter a comment. Very smooth operation, speedy - I\\'ve not used this version of Windows, so taking my time to test drive newer applications. BUT, very pleased. Would recommend. Starts very fast, good price. I bought this for school to make digital art and animation. It works well for those purposes, but I\\'ve honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games. Pretty much everything from like PS3/360 era and before can run at high settings fairly stably. I don\\'t think it can even launch most newer triple A games, so I haven\\'t even tried. This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there\\'s a learning process. I\\'m using it to start working at home. My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters, etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys. It arrived in very good condition 😊 I got this laptop from the treasure truck. I have been wanting a new laptop so it was perfect timing. This laptop was really easy to get set up. I haven\\'t had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it\\'s much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work. It\\'s not a touch screen, which I really like. I might use it for video games at some point but that\\'s not my main priority with this laptop. I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.\\n\\nI wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available. The screen is bright and easy to view, however, the keypad is difficult to view unless you have light right on top of the computer. The keys are labeled in silver with the overall keyboard also in silver. I had to call in a professional I.T. person to set-up the computer. Windows 11 created major problems for him and took him hours of research to solve the problems (especially with the HP printer) and he has been working with computers for over 20 years! I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account. The computer works perfectly. Very nice laptop at this price point ($500). No back light of course, also no User Manual as far as I can tell. Would buy it again. This laptop is more for social Media app games etc. It\\'s good but very little memory and the screen resolution is poor Fast computer for college. Clear screen. My Kindle books are crystal clear Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it’s too early to rate but so far I’m very pleased. It’s very slim and lightweight. The set up was super easy. It boots up almost instantly. The key board is easy to maneuver. The built in mouse pad works extremely well. The screen quality is very good & the monitor is bright. I only use it for basic things like email, social media, research, on line shopping, etc so it fits my needs perfectly. The battery life is decent. It came loaded with Windows 11 which is great but unfortunately Windows 11 is not compatible with my printer. The trade off is that Windows 11 is far superior to Windows 10 in all other respects. The test will be to see how long it all holds up. I’m optimistic though! I\\'m still learning how to use the features. As far as I know it does not have a touch screen. It has issues connecting to the internet/wi-fi after updating. It does not have a place to connect an ethernet cable which I should have checked before buying. It allows me to do what I need to do so far. The brand makes very good products, it works excellent, but for the amount I ended up paying, I would have preferred to buy a 15.6-inch one, since I was charged twice for imports. One is charged by AMAZON at the time of purchase and you also pay the import fee to the FEDEX Mexico parcel service at the time of delivery. I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one. The screen is huge! The processing apeed is okay too. It\\'s just that i\\'m not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard. The letters shift to the left because of the additional numbers on the right side. Other than that, it is very good quality laptop and I\\'m satisfied qith it. Sometimes when I write on social media, E-mails ect, if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it. Could be my fault. Otherwise I like it. My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed. I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money. I love my new laptop! It is fast and works really good! So far I have not had any problems with the Laptop Media Tek MT 7921 WiFi 6 802.ax adapter does not consistently start from the sleep mode. Every 3 to 6 days it goes dead. Same condition happens with both 2.4 and 5 GHz. It can be recovered by completely powering off and turning it back on. This might have to be done a couple of times. The driver version is 3.0.1.1167 and is the current driver per HP\\'s web page. The laptop works OK with a Cat 6 internet connection. A UNI USB C to Ethernet adapter cable is required as well as a Cat 6 cable direct to a router port. An extra expense to keep it running. This is a workaround till I can find time to work with HP. I would like to install a new wi-fi adapter. We purchased this for my dad for Christmas. It is his first ever laptop. It\\'s great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on. He absolutely loves it! I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books. it\\'s not built for gaming at all. Very easy to set up Very nice I use this laptop for work, especially spreadsheets and data every and I\\'m very pleased with the quality. I got this computer because I wanted an affordable pc after years of macs and hating their keyboard. A couple things I have notice about this computer…\\n\\nKeyboard and pad are nice, good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark. And to right click on the track pad still confuses me.\\n\\nScreen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting.\\n\\nComputer is a little flimsy when folding/unfolding.\\n\\nWindows 11 I am actually pretty happy with. Takes a little getting used to but I like the os.\\n\\nOverall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy. You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for. Only 2 weeks into using it and all is good so far. I’ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences. I think this will also be a good purchase. I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews. But I’m glad that I did because my pc arrived early, and in good quality, I’m in love. And yes it’s for gaming also because I played on it, and it performed well. If you’re thinking about getting this DO IT!!!!! Don’t listen to these people (most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it) For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd. The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use. Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive. Glad I bought this. i bought it when from Treasure Truck, i got very good discount...i already use it for a while, everything work very well so far... love this laptop Excellent value for the price. Had everything I needed tbh This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in 2013. I was not unhappy with my 8+ year old machine, but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation, and the battery needed replacement. The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice.\\n\\nI found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials, or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software. I am still in the transfer process. This is disappointing. Great laptop, plenty fast for home recording with no latency. I\\'ve had it for about 6 months now with absolutely no issues. it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user. After some struggle now the laptop is usable, support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support. Average price more computer than needed for the person I gifted it to Look at the photo. The lettering on the silver keyboard is so faint that you can\\'t see the keys from many angles and in less than direct light! Who thought up this disaster? The computer arrived securely packaged. It looks and performs just as advertised. Although it doesn\\'t have a touchscreen, it performs well otherwise. I needed thiz. Enjoy the functions, but no CD ROM everything worked just great. was delivered to my us imaginary address, then forwarded by our logistics company outside the us, arrived safe and sound. works so far so good-knock knock. The computer looks and feels sleek. It’s a powerful unit. But it doesn’t matter at all when windows 11 has a fault that will endlessly disconnect the wireless network adapter inside the laptop itself. If you can afford something newer, or ever run windows 10 for the time being, I recommend that highly. I’m so pissed at this laptop, I’ve probably reset the network settings and restarted it 10,000 times in 3 months. screen very good Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she’s enjoying it immensely Had no issues. Product was fine, and shipping was quick. I thought I had bought the right la too. But the battery dies really fast. Don’t recommend it. Needed a new one I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck. But like many of the other reviews stated, there is constantly issues with the WiFi. Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep, the next time I boot it up, WiFi cannot be located. Long story short…..I returned the damn thing. I like it lighter then the old one It’s fast, it’s easy to use, and it was just as advertised! This new computer was a Christmas gift for our daughter and it is perfect for her daily use. My husband really likes this laptop. With the clear screen. And easy to use process. He uses it everyday. I ordered it with shipping to Honduras (through a post office box in Miami and it arrived in perfect condition. I loved it. It\\'s super fast 😁 Like it was easy to fire it up This was a Christmas present for my wire, she was very happy with it. Love it so far and very fast. Fast shipping too Laptop did a system update that deleted the wifi drive. Tried many options, but cannot restore wifi. Tried to restore to factory settings, but now windows won’t even open. Did a google search an learned this is a popular problem many had with their laptops as well.\\n***UPDATE***\\nAmazon support transferred me to HP since it is still under 1yr manufacture warranty. After long calls and multiple attempts, HP support was able to restore to factory settings. I missed days of work, lost records, had to get my computer setup for work all over again. I was told I could seek compensation, I would have to send in a company letter head stating the amount of pay I lost. After a week of calls from their supervisors who kept escalating the issue, I got the end user. He claimed there is no such thing as compensation and that all the previous supervisors lied to me. I was offered a $25 coupon for a future HP product. I\\'m going back to MAC. It\\'s a great laptop for the price! Very good I bought this to replace my current i3 Dell, which is 6 years old. It has slowed down considerably, and it constantly loses its wifi connection. At first, about a year ago, it would happen once or twice a week, but now it happens every few minutes. NOT my wifi. All other devices work fine. I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago, and it only made it worse. I need reliable WIFI for my job, to attend Zoom and Teams meetings. Out of the box, I was impressed with this model\\'s speed and connectivity. But, I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home, it would not connect again. It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished. It\\'s only a week old. I\\'m returning this and going back to Dell. Thought this to be an ok mid- priced unit. Liked it at first. Then it kept dropping off line. The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting. This happened about every 5-10 minutes. Two other computers in my house do not do that. Internet is fine. Sent it back as defective. They deducted $91.47 as a restocking fee. FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE. Do not buy this unit. Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly. Just about 7 weeks after its April 29th delivery, this computer booted up to a different interface and we could not get the system back to its normal function despite the many options shown on the screen including selecting the option to do a fresh install of windows, system restore, etc. I am now left with a fancy shell of an inoperable device. I thought we were getting a nice, basic, laptop for my senior mother. It was nice for a few weeks then started having issues and eventually the option for wifi completely disappeared. After 10+ hours troubleshooting with windows and it’s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period. I don’t recommend this device. It is flimsy- which is a little expected considering price. Also not a touch screen. Overall I would not recommend this laptop. I only used it a couple of days when I got up one morning and it wouldn\\'t pick up any wifi networks. I tried to find out why, but there was nothing showing as to why it wouldn\\'t find any networks. So I had to once again break out my old, outdated laptop.\\n\\nWhile I was able to use it, it was working OK. The only issue I had with it was I was unable to unlock and move the taskbar. When left clicking the taskbar, only \"taskbar settings\" would show up, with no option to unlock it. I am waiting to see if Amazon / HP will honor the warranty. My laptop developed vertical lines less than 3 months after i bought it. Based on a test it was determinized that it was a hardware issue. The laptop was not subject to abuse. I am a 62 year old granny that keeps my laptop in my home. I do not carry my laptop around.\\nI will let you know if Amazon / HP make it good. Thanks Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon. The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it. It had a \"second life\" used/refurbished sticker affixed to it. I looked up the serial number on HP\\'s website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it 3 months ago.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in this laptop, I\\'d suggest you look for it elsewhere. I can\\'t trust Amazon to send a new unit. Do not buy! Within a month of purchasing, the wireless adapter just suddenly stopped working and disappeared. Upon further reading of the reviews of this computer, apparently this is a common problem. So save yourself the frustration and avoid buying this. I\\'m giving Amazon high marks for giving me the option to return it for a full refund without hassle. This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up. I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working. I’ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it. I’m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out. Set it up and then one day later it wouldn\\'t identify the WiFi. I tried network reset , reset adapter but nothing worked. Had to send it back. Don\\'t buy this one. There is some problem with the WiFi adapter. Barely two weeks after having received the laptop, the wifi drivers are barely working. The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections.\\n\\nYesterday, no amount of restarts worked, and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished. I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working. Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery. Sending mines back. Wifi function routinely disappears. The fix is spending hours on the phone with hp while they completely wipe the laptop and reinstall everything. Really handy. 👌 AND since there\\'s no ethernet port, it\\'s basically the most worthless laptop available. Purchased brand new. Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in. There\\'s also a fun bug in Windows 11 that turns off the wifi by itself and won\\'t let you turn it back unless you do a full power-down (I\\'ve run all Windows updates). Restarting the computer doesn\\'t fix the issue. Pretty bummed out that I\\'ve only had this a few months and it\\'s a complete lemon. Not sure I\\'ve had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before. Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows.\\n\\nThe I5 processor is surprisingly good. Averaging only a 4٪ decrease in performance against the I7 model.\\n\\nNot suitable for gaming IMO. But I would recommend to most pc users. Power users will know this is not what they are looking for.\\n\\nFor price- it\\'s a fabulous deal The C - unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller. I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for $900. It had instability: frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior. After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem (they convinced me not to return it), I had to leave the country for several months. The problem persisted. At some point, HP installed Win 11 surreptitiously. This stopped my microsoft programs from working (I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win10 and do not work in win11). I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support. They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows 11 to win 10 at no charge. I did not accept. In June, just before the warranty expired, I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months. I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise. This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess. This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business (the first was in 2007, and I gave them a second chance). HP is both inept and dishonest. Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov 29th. Box was never opened until Christmas morning. Wife was thrilled. Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the 30th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection. I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead. I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken. The laptop has no ethernet ports. Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed. The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 MT7921 (2x2) and Bluetooth® 5.2 combo (Supporting Gigabit data rate) internal chipset. I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn\\'t connect. I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning. After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network. As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point.\\nThere\\'s a lot to like about this laptop (excellent processor, good amount of ram, so-so SSD storage) but a lot to dislike about it also. No up-gradable storage or ram, no backlit keyboard, gray on silver lettering on the keyboard, no removable/swap-able battery (it\\'s internal).\\nI have used HP products for 25 years and had my fair shape of issues with them but they have generally proven reliable. This is the poorest implementation of a $540 laptop I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s going back to Amazon for a full refund. I have seen others with the same issues on HP\\'s support site and it\\'s a relatively new laptop. What a waste of money, time and effort. HP, if your going to integrate everything in a throwaway design at least make it reliable for few years. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this for anyone. I was lucky (if you can call it that), mine failed within a week of ownership. Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available. The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over. Start up was fast. Everything is fast on this laptop. Buy this one! You won\\'t regret it. Very nice laptop. It does what I need and was easy to get started with. I am more than pleased with how easy it was transferring my files/photos, etc from my old laptop to this one. Being a senior, I am limited at times dealing with \"technology\" and since I keep all my records in a \"vault\" recovery of those files was critical for retaining my medical, financial, photo\\'s, etc it was important not to lose them. My old laptop had zero memory available, but I was able to \"link\" the use of both laptops and transfer my files with little effort at all. Very happy with this purchase Ignore the bad reviews this is a very good laptop . I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a new laptop! I love the size. It has everything I wanted except a touch screen which isn\\'t important now that my granddaughter is older. The speed is great and it has a 10 key which I hadn\\'t noticed until I received it. It\\'s very good, the laptop works well, and it kept well, the only problem was the time taken to arrive, more than a month, the problem not from the seller but the company that you send the order in my country. thanks amazon! Great price for all the features Very fast and efficient; responds well when scrolling down, and back to top; so far it is an excellent Laptop! Got this for my 17 year old son for school. It works great, fast, picture is SUPER clear, speakers were awesome. It was an excellent price for everything that comes in this laptop. All around its a good laptop. Its fast and reliable. However... there is nearly zero gaming potential. This thing only has 0.13 go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go. Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem. With all that said everything else is great.👍 Wife uses this for work and has done well so far waited a little bit before review to see how it would be and has been great! Battery has been solid screen great and easy to use easy set up light weight and durable to an extent feels a little flimsy but it’s a slim laptop shipping was fast great product so far !!! Works perfectly, love it. Is fast, and it was a great value for the money. Styling is a very beautiful laptop and good for whatever I want to do with it but I’m mostly studying with it. And it was safely packaged. It came in a big box though which may have been for safety but seemed wasteful. It is 11th gen, and it has no backlight keyboard, hard to use at night. Overall, a very good laptop I am more than pleased with my new laptop. It was more than I expected in a laptop This is my 3rd HP laptop and my first windows 11 pc. I bought it to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 HP Stream that I have kept up to date. I will be using this mostly for web browsing and streaming video and can truly say I\\'m amazed by just how much faster this is. Video and sound quality is excellent and web pages load instantly. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new laptop for personal use. My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition! I mostly use it for work, but have used it for some older games and it works well. I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers. Bought this over a year ago and love it. Just bought a second one for my father and he’s happy too. Great price great machine and it’s lightning fast. I use it mostly for work so Microsoft a office products. Some tv streaming. Very satisfied and will recommend it to anyone Can\\'t speak to battery life - haven\\'t tried using it for long period on battery. Great for casual internet and streaming use. Bought mainly as it came pre--loaded with Windows 11. This product met my expectations. I use it to run software for my Laser Engraver. i bought an external Docking device that allows me to have more USB ports, and an Ethernet port as well as a few more. Excellent notebook, fast, light, the screen has a perfect resolution. Easy setup. Works perfect for wife\\'s home business. She uses MS Teams and Zoom often, along with Office software.\\nThe only thing that bugged me with initial setup is it forced the upgrade to Windows 11. I don\\'t have an issue with W11, just would have appreciated having the choice to upgrade right away, or wait. Other than that, the Laptop itself seems to be working fine. I bought this laptop for my husband for his 65th birthday. His laptop was 11 years old and was on it’s last leg. He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past 11 years but this one is perfect! The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers. He plays word games and does puzzles, explores websites, he emails,,spends time on Facebook, checks out his sports, neighborhood stuff, etc… and if he wants to explore more, he can. It’s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease.\\nIt’s perfect and the price was SO right!! Oh, I also purchased the insurance plan just in case. That too is a great deal and great idea, in my opinion!\\n5 Stars! My wife use it for every day work. Is lite and easy to use. Verry good laptop and not to expensive. The shipment was fast Update: It got stuck 3 more times and won\\'t connect to the wifi unless it is shut down, will be returning unfortunately.\\n\\nI bought this computer to replace a Toshiba laptop I\\'ve had for years and is now dying on me. I do like this computer, and I\\'ve only had one issue so far. It got hung up and I had to shut it down and restart it to be able to reconnect to the wi-fi. Other than that it has been great. It\\'s fast and lightweight. I use it primarily for note taking, journaling, and household tracking (such as finances) through word and excel and for those reasons I love it. The camera is better than my old laptop but nothing stellar. I have not tried to stream video or used sound yet so I can\\'t comment on that. Overall happy with my purchase so far, as long as it doesn\\'t have the issue with the wi-fi again. I love the touch screen. Very good screen quality. Easy set-up. SSD is great. Fast internet connection. Large 15 inch screen. Getting familiar with windows 11. I think I got a good deal for black Friday specials on this computer. Would have given 5 stars but it keeps disconnecting and losing the wireless adapter. The first time it completely disappeared from the system and I had to reload it from the HP site. It was a pain to get it reloaded and connected! The second time, it disconnected from the wireless adapter but it was still on the system. I restarted and it reconnected. It\\'s a significant inconvenience to not have wireless capabilities on a laptop!\\n\\nOther than the wireless adapter issue, the laptop is fast, the screen is bright and clear, and it performs as expected . good buy Does what I need and for a great price from the Treasure Truck Like it, great product for what I want to use it for This is a great laptop! I love it!! After 2, 3 days trading with amazon.com, it\\'s symbol showed up on the 1st app web page. I realized that this is built with an advanced AI system. Amazon has been collecting data concerning my buying habit for many years, and it suggesting this and that beforehand. But it will never be like human, because human mind is many hued animal. Great laptop for price Very good I had the exact same laptop, but much older. It was definitely time to upgrade to a new one. HP is the only affordable laptop with a 17” screen. Have been very happy with this computer. Works great so far. Will say at least for what I expect from a computer. I love the size of the screen! Makes it great for work. Have had no issues. Poor contrast with keyboard keys. Poor design by HP, I would say! Lots of people do not have excellent vision! White on black would have been much better, as shown on my hand held calculator. Getting accustomed to Windows 11 is another story, for a later time! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ opened and up and running in ten min. Nice for the price!!!! For $299 a great buy. Even has Solid State drive. I rarely ever use my computer anymore. I forgot to update to win11 so instead of buying it, just buy new. My old Lenovo (2016) was very slow. I swear they program it to slow down after 5 years. A great laptop well please.. It\\'s incredibly fast, and the 17 inch screen is a joy! Works fine Half of what it cost about 3 years ago! Great computer, comes with MS word package. Big screen. Great sound speakers. Very happy! Wish it was a bit smaller but all in all I\\'m much happier than the Chromebook I bought the year before. Very fast, long battery life. The HD camera is great for streaming Great investment Easy to use. Good size Happy so far with no complaints!! Decent laptop to do basic stuff, not a good option for gaming or graphics. Good for email, basic internet browsing and some streaming. It is a nice laptop. The quality is good. But it is not cheap. I mainly use this computer for working at home and some internet browsing. It is much faster than the laptop with an i5 processor and twice the ram than it replaced. For general tasks that aren\\'t too demanding it is a good affordable option. This is a really nice laptop Windows 11 not as friendly to users as 8 or 10.\\nThis unit has intermittent ethernet port causing really strange problems. WiFi works fine. I have had the laptop for less than 2 months, and it does not work well at all:\\n\\n1) It will routinely disconnect from Wifi, even when I am in the same room as the router.\\n2) I try to link my airpods to it using Bluetooth, and they won\\'t stay connected, even though these airpods can connect to my work computer and my phone very easily without any problems.\\n3) Every so often, when I turn the computer on, I get a message saying that a heating fan is not spinning and that I would have to try turning on the computer later.\\n\\nI like saving money, and I don\\'t need anything beyond the basics in a laptop... but I would like a computer that can turn on, stay connected to the internet, and allow Bluetooth pairing without causing me consistent problems.\\n\\nDo not buy this product. Wow! No backlit keyboard and that is NOT disclosed on the product page!!!!\\nCant see the keys! Bought a monitor light bar. Far better! Screen is not lit well and the vibrance is terrible! Works fine but the casing is defective and already falling apart. Now the laptop cannot be closed. HP technical support offered to have it shipped back for repairs and said they would return it within 7 to 9 business days. Who can be without their laptop for 2 weeks? My son can’t because he’s taking online colleges classes. Beware of Amazon Lightning deals. You get what you pay for. I did notike the fact that right in the middle of reading the news, a porn sight popped up and my computer was locked down so I am returning it asap! the lettering on the keyboard is barely legible. no contrast. silver on silver? who designed this and thought it was good? Delivered with box hanging open and damaged. Want to return laptop and not sifters. Cannot rely on laptop working correctly or for adequate amount of time. Extra screen size, nice screen quality. Over all this is a very fine product. It was time for me to replace my old laptop that I had for years. It’s easy to overuse them and wear them out. I found that it’s also cheaper to just replace it. I always prefer Dell and HP products. This is my 3rd HP and I love it! I have a desktop at home and this is a great laptop that I can take on the go. Has all the latest features and I am still learning everything but so far this was a great buy and it\\'s super fast 👌. I like the size and the picture but windows 11 is hard to use big learning curve wish it was more like xp just basic is all i need just trying to put a app on the desk top screen is hard no drag and place good performance for my non-game use.\\nI use it for remote office work, the larger screen is good for semi-permanent setup.\\nI use a detached keyboard and mouse, the key contrast is too light, which is common with the sliver keycaps. Computer for little surfing and really more than I need. This computer is really nice and would recommend to anyone. Seems to work fine. I like the big screen and the ample SSD storage. Wish the keyboard was lit, otherwise, it\\'s perfect. Thank you for a quality product and fast shipping. First, it\\'s an HP. I have come to trust HP for reliability and price. It\\'s a little slow for me because it only has 4GB of RAM, which I knew when I bought it so I\\'m not faulting them. It has a SSD, which is only what I buy now. Boot time is faster and things run faster for me with a SSD. Screen is excellent in size and display.\\nOnly real issue I had was not with the product, but with shipping. Normally Amazon wraps the heck out of things but not this time. I\\'m glad HP had it securely packaged but Amazon put it in another box with absolutely no padding. When I picked it up the inner box was just bouncing around inside. Who knows what it endured on it\\'s way. Thankfully there doesn\\'t seem to be any damage thanks to HP packing it well.\\nHighly recommend this laptop if you just need something to browse the internet and do some other tasks. It\\'s not a gaming computer so don\\'t expect it to be. All in all, I\\'m happy with this. i bought this because i work from home. it was very easy to set up, it runs well, good cpu speed for multitasking, nice keys, nice screen, and surprisingly good speakers. the biggest problem i have is the battery life. it\\'s advertised as an average 8.15 hours but i started working 3.5 hours ago with 100% battery life and with battery saver on and performance settings chosen by windows, i\\'m sitting at 28%. wtf but if i choose best performance but then the text will be difficult to read and everything will just look horrible\\n\\nalso, there\\'s not light indicator for the num lock button, as there is for mute, caps lock and power, so when you pressing numbers on the right, if you inadvertently press num lock, you\\'re not typing anything. that can get annoying works great really needed this . For the price this is a great laptop! It\\'s fast and responsive! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! The wide screen allows me to work with multiple windows making drag and drop easy. The only thing that annoys me is that you need to use the Fn key to access F keys. This works wonderfully for what I need it for! It responds very fast, and the pictures are sharp and clear. The solid state memory has been a pleasant surprise, as it\\'s the first of its kind I have owned. 1....This seems to be a good computer, fairly reasonably priced, very light and thin. Fast.\\n2.....I\\'m not sure yet about the battery. I\\'ve had one incident in which the notice came on that the battery was low. Usually, I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery. This is the second one, the first had a problem and had to be returned. There was some confusion with HP and Amazon, but Amazon came through for us. However, the return wasn\\'t as smooth as most Amazon returns, possibly because it was a computer. It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don\\'t shop at.\\n3... The silver keyboard is attractive but makes it hard to see. This could be fixed by making the letters thicker, therefore darker.\\n\\nIt is, all in all, a good machine. Love it! I need hot spot but it works really well. I love the computer. I like the laptop but the description is wrong on the site no back lit keyboard no finger touch log on .. it’s working fine but false advertising as it’s best it’s like the reviews are for all the laptops like this model because it says on thing in the description only to not have it when it shows up Laptop operates at a good speed and is reliable. Everything is fine accept for the fact that it doesn’t have a backlit keyboard as advertised. I will be contacting Amazon. It\\'s a good tool It was represented as a gaming laptop. It\\'s far from that but it is what it is The speed of the laptop is very good, I have it with Windows 11, it runs programs like photoshop and illustrator very well, in the gaming part I would give it an 8 out of 10, gears 5 does not run very well, I have made several configurations but closes, other games like Dragon Ball FighterZ run them just fine. In terms of hardware, it would have been more comfortable to have the power button at one of the two ends and not near the delete button, in general it is a very good computer, for work issues it is very good. I have not yet investigated whether it works with windows hello, at the moment it only allows me to login with a PIN, it does not have a fingerprint option. I bought this product to replace my old 1737 Dell Studio Laptop so I can work from home and perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\\nI was a Dell fan for many years and at first was hesitant to buy this HP Laptop, but ultimately decided to go for ir since it offered me a brand new machine with the screen size that I was used to, the latest software and processor generation available and more importantly a solid state drive. At this price I could only get older, used or refurbished laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer.\\nI waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I\\'m glad I waited and found this one for under $700.\\nI\\'ve been using this laptop for over 2 months now and I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything looks and works great, fast startup and shutdown and it doesn\\'t get hot after many hours of continuous use.\\nI bought a USB splitter and a lamp that I can place right over the keyboard and the lack of multiple USB ports and a back-lit keyboard was solved!!! Like screen size and speed. Great value The screen is great. But it arrived with nothing to plug it in for charging. I had to find one from an old computer. There is no touch screen or back up light. Value for the money!\\nLight weight Very good Love this computer! Ease of use and extremely fast! Easy to use, windows 11 is set up a lot different than 10 Very nice laptop. Will do everything I need it to do. very good computer Seems to work well with what I use it for but would have liked a built in disc drive and SD card slots. This is not a touch screen. I’ve had it less than a week but so far all seems to be really good. No complaints! I\\'ve had this laptop for about almost 4 months. Everything was going great until two nights ago when the laptop began to glitch. The cursor is blinking overtime. I have an extension mouse as well and I have to use that one in order to get to what I am trying to open. The amount of money $650 for this item and it\\'s clutching. I bought this for my business. I figured I wouldn\\'t have to purchase a new one for a while. However, this is not good. I have had a 17 inch HP for about a decade and was shamed into updating since it was running Windows 8. That and I had loaded it down to the point it as sloooww. Bought this newer version and very happy. Not getting laughed at which is worth the price of admission. I have only had this laptop for a week.\\nThe start up is quick I was pleasantly surprised how fast it is and how quick it handles a lot of things at once.\\nWould highly recommend! I love this laptop...It works great and has been a great addition to my home office. This product is for home use. It\\'s easy to hook up and has great features. Delivery was earlier than projected which was a plus. A great computer and all I hoped for. I am very happy with the laptop. It has been a struggle with learning windows 11. I bought this product for college and I paid the amount which is really expensive. I finally got it and I was so happy to get my new computer but it didn’t even come with windows. I paid $520 dollars for a useless computer then I need to pay $200 more just to get windows. No thank you. I sent it back and am waiting for a refund. Very fast processing speed. Great graphics. So far just a month with it. But the large 17\" screen, the processing speed i love. Light up keyboard would have been a great idea though seeing that I use this mostly at nights when i\\'m home. However, no complaints. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Respect from Jamaica. This is a nice little \"utility computer\", seems to have everything I need (no touch screen, but knew that ahead of time). BUT.... HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way. The forward facing camera, while it appears to work just fine, it is NOT an \"IR\" camera and therefore, Windows can NOT log you in using the camera. So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I\\'ll be typing in passwords and/or PIN\\'s. Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP\\'s literature. Seems a bit twisted to come pre-installed with Windows-11, but then due to a cheap, made in china camera, Windows \"Hello Face\" feature is completely unsupported. Would NOT buy this product again. Ever. This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this... A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more. And then to not be up front about this and kind of \"hide\" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least. Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using. Makes me wonder where else in their selection of hardware that they got equally CHEAP with to save a few pennies. Nice size screen fast does everything I need This actually has no touch screen, so cannot rate that part. It is a good, fast laptop, and has good battery life Sold as having a backlit keyboard and it doesn\\'t. Overall operation is great. But wish the keyboard lite up!! This is a misrepresentation of the product. If I knew this, would not have bought it!!! Picture quality is great Its twice as fast as my other computer . It has HD,lots of storage This laptop is my personal computer. It\\'s so fast, easy to read due to the large screen, & love the feel of the keyboard. I love everything about it! I purchased this laptop for a tech bootcamp and while I was excited to get it and am in love with the size, the specs are different from what I got.\\n\\nThere isn’t a backlit keyboard, it doesn’t have windows 11, and the internet keeps dropping while I’m in class, etc.\\n\\nI contacted the seller and they immediately sent me shipping info for a return. I decided not to since I can update to Windows 11 myself, and then that’s when the wifi started dropping, randomly. Amazon won’t give me an option to talk to one of their reps and the seller is…\\n\\nIn my opinion, find a better deal with less hassle. Was easy to set up with no problems. One of the best Laptop computers I have ever bought. So far so good Love it this is my first laptop Bought this for myself and it was fine for about six months, then the fan went out. Right after buying it for myself, I bought one for my mom. Hers came straight out of the box with a fan problem and had to be returned to Amazon for a replacement. With two instances of buying this laptop, I’ve had two fan malfunctions way before I should have expected any issues. Seems to be a common problem. Great price. Exactly as described I like this computer easy to find and type numbers and letters Fast and easy to use. Bought this laptop so I would work abroad for 5 weeks. For few days before trip, worked fine. Morning I am leaving, at airport, it crashes. I could not even get to log in screen. Kept receiving error messages. So, I get to Greece and spend 2 days running around to stores to fix it. Returning this piece of junk as soon as I get back to the US. Nice sleek\\nLong lasting battery Mostly Amazon shows, facebook I liked it very good A great replacement Nice laptop. Convenient, fast, and nice experience with Windows 11.\\nBut the battery life is poor.\\nWith a battery charged 100% the battery is exhausted in about 7 hours. For routine daily use you pretty much have to leave the laptop plugged into the charger.\\n\\nI previously wrote the above review. I must change it. I consider this laptop to be a REAL LEMON. STAY AWAY. While recognizing that Windows 11 is yet another Microsoft upgrade, it must be loaded with undocumented features, i.e. bugs. Seems that anything you try to do invariably brings up an offer for product purchase or requires a password. Willing to battle through for the sake of trying a new IOS the fun started to increase exponentially when I tried to install HP Smart to use my all in one HP ENVY 6400 printer. There is absolutely NO ACCESSIBLE HP support. Everything you try leads to an offer to \"Chat\" with the HP Smart Agent. All you can do there is respond to questions it asks. When none of the questions apply to your problem, DEAD END. It\\'s wonderful. I did not discover that I could not install programs such as Google chrome or other independent programs or my church or local companies that I order items from. Is there any way I can oder another more expensive laptop. I have only used thjis for primarily to read some issues of oour newspaper that are not printed on sATURDAYS The battery does not hold charge. Fully charged battery lost 20% after 30 minutes from unplugging. The bottom of laptop gets really hot. I would not recommend. Will return due to the incredible amount of heat that it puts out. Excessive heat shortens the life of electronics. For the cost, I expected better. only thing missing is a CD Drive\\nEVERYTHING WORKS WELL\\nGreat Laptop ; you get what you pay for Perfect It’s a great laptop for the price and space. Easy to set up! Dependable product. I love my hp lap top. It is not a touch screen.\\nTook a little getting use\\nTo windows 11 but I love it now. Worth the money. Use it a lot for home use. Not business. I am using this to replace my old laptop at. Home. This one is so much faster to boot up and perform any activity. I had my friend help me pick it out because he\\'s good at this kind of stuff. I\\'ve had the computer now a few weeks and I\\'m well pleased with it. The only thing I wished is that the screen was brighter and they should make the power button stand out more than the rest of the keys. It\\'s a little hard to find. Next time I think I would like to get one where the keys light up. But overall I think it\\'s a lot of computer for the money. Great This laptop is great for getting clerical work or simple tasks such as web based business or office products completed. I\\'d say the only real drawback is the screen quality. It looks rather washed out, but otherwise it works great for what I need it to do. Great for work, good for watching videos, and naturally, bad for video games with the exception simple pixel or old indie games. It also doesn\\'t have a SD card reader built in, but you can get a usb adaptar for that. If you are going to process a lot of data at one time, such as large databases or many browser windows, I suggest upgrading the RAM to 12 or 16GB as the 8GB it comes with gets eaten up quickly. It is a simple and inexpensive upgrade and HP made accessing it easy. Just watch out for the hidden screws under the rubber grips. Nice laptop for school. Easy to use. Very fast. Good storage. Lightweight. Love the big screen. I was thrilled to find this computer for our homeschool family. It is working great. This came with Windows 10 S which seems fairly secure. I have already upgraded to Windows 11 S.\\nYou can download apps only from the Microsoft store which is a disappointment. The app store is very limited so you\\'ll probably find that your favorite apps aren\\'t there and cannot be loaded on your machine.\\nApps like Google Earth Pro, Google Earth, banking and financial apps cannot be loaded. You can remove the S but then you cannot put it back. This chromebook laptop is great for what it costs. The price-tag reflects the chromebook\\'s natural lack of sophisticated abilities, but this laptop is great for students on the go. The battery life is conducive to a faster-paced schedule and lasts well into the day without a charge. Easily customizable, this computer is well worth its price. Love it😍😍 It was very nice looking the screen was large and clear. And was very light Weight. I\\'ve only had it for 1 month but, the tablet was super easy to set up, the keyboard is easy to use, and super fast response! The battery life is superb. I use it for emails, web surfing and its surprisingly good for watching movies ,TV and listening to music. The Bluetooth is a big plus for me I use my earbuds and Bluetooth speaker. So far so good! I recommend virus protection! It definitely is worth the MONEY! Sleek and cost effective Battery life is great and super light weight Good for what I need it for but does have a habit of blacking out when in the middle of something. Not sure why it does that. I have had other Chromebooks that did the same thing. It runs apps, and can use Linux although that takes some setting up. had to watch some videos to see what i could install. overall a stable decent laptop for under 200 bucks. dont expect to play games on it though. i use it mostly for web browsing and email. Overall, after I figured out how to get the touch pad activated, I found it to be a really good PC. I purchased this as I needed a light simple laptop to take with me when I travel. I didnt need anything super fast or high dollar as I use my custom built desktop for that. I ordered this knowing it was able to be returned. I was surprised and very happy with what I got. Package was well packed. Simple. Laptop and charging cable. I charged it for a few hours and setup was a breeze. Computer is nice, light, and works well. The chrome OS is a little harder to setup and get where you want but its something you can GOOGLE!!\\n\\nIf there is ANYTHING I can gripe about it is this. The keyboard is in lower case and I doint like that. Thats it!! If I already put a comment on this before my opinion hasn\\'t changed any. I bought a refurbished one, but the company said it was new -- whatever -- it was in excellent condition. I had no complaints on that!\\n\\nIt works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department. I might have wished for USB ports -- but so far I have no reason to use them.\\n\\nApparently, this true of --any-- HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard, and it wiii be a bear to replace! I hope it has a very long life!\\n\\nI got it at a good price, the in-house Linux was easy to set up, that\\'s one very important reason the 64 GB disk space was important to me, so I have no problem recommending this Chromebook. I purchased this laptop for school work, singing, and podcasting. I love it, and give it a big ups 💯💻 My MacBook was giving me a hard time so I needed a new laptop fast for work that was cheap. This exceeded my expectations! It\\'s great but for Google only This is a great laptop for the price however it\\'s not touchscreen it\\'s very light weight and easy for Travel . purchased this chromebook in Sept. of last year. it came boxed with a notice inside saying they upgraded the resolution to a higher definition than originally suppose to have come with and boy did it show. I\\'m am a true believer in a chromebook. it\\'s fast. easy to use and can do almost everything my hp windows laptop use to do. the upgrades are fast and it notifies you when upgrade is available and all one needs to do is press the restart button and that\\'s it. I get my internet thru my lan line phone co. which also provides a top notch anitvirus. luv everything about this laptop. Overall I love this computer. If you\\'re in need of a low budget laptop this is the product you want. It\\'s under $200 and you can not beat it . You don\\'t have to download/pay for Microsoft Word it comes with its own. I love it I really do. Thank You I decided to purchase this laptop after my desktop computer was annihilated from a windows update. My desktop is currently up and running again although it\\'s running slow, so I figured having a backup of some sort where I can access important documents and whatnot is smart in case of emergencies (i.e. work or school). It\\'s hard to believe this is a refurbished laptop because it runs so smoothly. Definitely a worthy purchase so far! Product showed up on time. Looks like brand new. This does everything I need it to do and was really inexpensive so I was a little skeptical on what type of product I was getting. I normally buy Apple products but needed something quick on a low budget and this is perfect. really like this affordable refurbished guy. i take it every where with me instead of my 5 lb laptop. take it in the hot tub and in the pool really great. great key board great screen. maybe one less point for the track pad but still good. great internet. fast and ready to go as soon as you open the puppy up. 0 problems 1 week in knock on wood. gooooood. Lightweight. Great size. I\\'ve been using for awhile now and no issues. I\\'m happy with this purchase. This was a gift; I can\\'t rate it, but my granddaughter is very happy with it. Love the device The unitmarrived quickly. Took it out of the box, and the first thing i noticed was it was very dirty; the underside was covered in handprints and fingerprints. Also noticed that it was not the same unit that was advertised. One feature listed was a micro sd reade, and this unit did nit have it. The last item was it would not connect to a wifi network. I did every diagnostic possible to inckude restting the device, the router, znd the modem, and it would not accept the router key. Every device i own is either refurbished or renewed, and this was the first one i had any issues with. Since tech support and other common-sense troubleshooting items couldnt fix it, i sent it back. Love loves it✨ Very productive at home and on the go 👌🏽✨😍 Was honestly expecting a unit with dings or scratches or looking refurbished. The only way you know it is refurbished is because it does not come in original packaging. VERY happy with this purchase so far. Would recommend to others! Wanted to replace a very old MacBook used for browsing while watching TV etc. Didn\\'t need anything high end obviously. Just something to online shop, pay a few bills, and watch YouTube.\\n\\nPurchased the Chromebook without a lot of research. Mostly price and reviews. After several months of use there aren\\'t any negatives other than a dead pixel or two. Impressed with overall speed and ease of use.\\n\\nWould purchase again. I love how fast it is and how clear the images are and the battery life is long enough to not have to charge it constantly, but when I do charge it it does so fast. I got it for personal use and future school work so it’s exactly what I was looking for Easy setup, small and lightweight. I had to return it because it had only one USB port. Excellent quality of material.. Super long-lasting battery.. Very easy to use, I am totally satisfied with my purchase, I do not regret doing it... 🥰🥰🥰 Not enough technical hardware, like CD player and extra USB connections. FAR to dependendent on the cloud for storage. Wow did this ever get here fast? Impressive speedy shipping and delivery. Very satisfied with the product so far. I\\'ve only had it a day, so time will tell overall, on how well it runs. Thank you. My kids needed them for school . These are great for the money. Good buy I needed a cheaper laptop just for school purposes. I wasn\\'t expecting too much based of the reviews for more than a regular work laptop. However, this laptop is downplayed. It can do a lot more and operates great. The only issue I have is the screen flickering when it\\'s about to die, but you can clearly tell why. This is not a touch screen. This laptop is a great starter laptop! Its small and light weight. The picture is great. The battery lasts forever. Very happy with this purchase!! Good times Light weight, seems to be pretty easy to use! Has a long battery life and completely charges in an hour or 2 I also like the fact it has a charging port on the left and right side of it! Our organizations didn\\'t have enough computers for everybody, so I purchased my own to leave at school. First, I received a really good looking machine. It made a seamless transition to every program I needed to get my work done. A battery charge lasts nearly the entire week. I feel I got a good value for the money. I am so happy that I took chance to make this purchase. It arrived quickly and in pristine condition. Workd great, saves the environment, as well and the need I have to have school on the go. Needed a laptop for school, am happy I got it works perfectly, light to carry around Lightweight, great battery life. The chromebook itself is fine but the usb charger was bent. I did a chat w amazon and they said they were shipping me a charger but it has not arrived yet. I emailed the seller and they said to order another charger and they would refund me? No thanks. Sounds risky. Order the “new again” almost worked perfectly but if the seller would have taken a quick glance they would have seen the bent usb plug. Still no charger has arrived. Great chromebook though This Laptop only has ONE USB port, I repeat ONE. I run a small business and I need a USB port for printer and label printer so this doesn’t cut it, will return. However overall it’s a pretty good laptop. For my son school clases Great product my son loves it!!! It is very nice. We can watch Netflix, videos, etc. You have to adjust the position in order to see a good image. My daughter couldn\\'t install the game she wanted to play. Sorry, don\\'t know why has to do something with the system. It\\'s really good for anything browser based, but physically cannot download most apps and programs, not even steam. Had no idea that chrome books are not compatible with most apple and window programs. If you want to have fun with a chrome book learn Linux. I was skeptical to buy a laptop for such a low price, but I took the risk and bought it. I cannot express how glad I am that I went for it. It came in perfect condition and it blew me away! Its the best laptop ive owned thus far. Its easy to use, has beautiful screen quality, and very lightweight. Its perfect for not only school and work, but I can also play games on the google play store so ive had a lot of fun with that. Overall its sleek, speedy, and super easy to use. :) All is good . We have no complaints Great buy Love it Great laptop when it worked; nice size and touch screen BUT battery stopped charging after 1 month of using it… purchased another charger but that didn’t make any difference This laptop is \"ok\" for the price but it has a few flaws. It does not have an HDMI port so you cannot use it for presentations. It only has 1 USB port so you cannot use a mouse and a jump drive or printer at the same time, all must be wireless. And the new style charger that is similar to a phone charger breaks easily. But if you just strictly need it to get online and do online schooling, it\\'s fine. Was a refurbished unit but works and looks like new. Was a great price for as much as you get. Battery life is about 6-8 hours. Way above my expectations this is the second h-p chromebook Iv\\'e had in the last five years. They are perfect for storage, transporting, and taking up very little space. Like the look and light weight. I use it at home for everything from internet to streaming movies , games and you tube. This refurbished chromebook has no noticeable difference from my original new chromebook. Everything about the computer is great but the touchpad is glitching and with think I’m clicking it when I’m not. The space bar will also freak out…I’ve tried a factory reset and doing research about the setting but nothing works. I don’t wanna waste my money on a mouse because you cant completely disable to touchpad :/ It really worked well for about two weeks. The money was quickly refunded and I purchased a different one and have had no problem with it. I needed a new computer to start college in the spring and was also on a budget. Refurbished was good way to go for me and definitely couldn\\'t beat the price. I purchased the non touchscreen version (I don\\'t see that to be a necessary feature) and I am very pleased with its performance, battery life, sleek design, and light weight. Highly recommend! It a good little laptop. Great price. Low storage was immediately upgraded. Love it and so easy to use\\nExcellent It came the next day no issues. It came charged. Set up was easy. You\\'d never know it was refurbished!! My pic is to give you an idea how big the screen is. Clear pictures. Runs fast. So happy with this buy!! I had to buy these for work in an emergency, they arrived early and saved a messy situation. The chrome books are in perfect shape, work superbly, and have long enough battery life for our needs. Plus they are full HD models, I wasn’t expecting that at this price point. I’d definitely get the same models from the same sellers again if needed. Its a basic Chromebook. Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do. Internet searching, emails and can stream amazon video. Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also. For the money...I think it was a great purchase. It’s good for price and work Very great I loved that it is a super light device it is perfect for the student at home or if you are passionate about working from home from social networks. It is super thin and you can carry it in your shopper style bag wherever you go. It’s great works good It’s definitely value for money.\\n64GB is good enough for daily usage.\\nIt is easy to use once you logged in. It is the first chrome-book that i have ever used. It’s easier than that i thought.\\nSize is good, light to carry and slim which makes it looks good. I didn’t activate touch screen yet, but seems like works good.\\nSatisfied. 😊 I like everything about the Chrome. It is a very fast computer. There was no problem and i hookup to my wifi\\neasily. I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it\\'s not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can\\'t do is a wireless connection to my printer. Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up. Works ok. It is a used laptop. I had my older laptop for last 8 years and it come time to upgrade. I did a research, and with my needs of accomplish many tasks in browser, I decided to purchase a Chromebook. My order came without delay. Chrome operation system include a lot of useful android applications. I am very happy with my choice. There’s no touch screen features but it’s lightweight and good price It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed. Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen. Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use. Can\\'t beat the price for this level of computer. We bought this product for my father in law as a gift. He\\'s a novice to say the least at technology and couldn\\'t be more pleased with the product. Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place. I would definitely order from them again! 1. Fast for Chrome OS. 2. Small size and light weight for 14 inch display. 3. Clear display quality. 4. Good sound of front pacing B&O speakers. 5. Long battery. 6. Good keyboard and touchpad. I loved it very good investment This computer arrived a couple of days late but looked brand new and was in perfect working order. It’s a great price, so glad we found it…. Part of the review criteria says touch screen? It’s not a touch screen though or if it is that option isn’t working? Really solid Chromebook for the price. This was the only laptop that was in my (very minimal) budget that was 4x64 instead of 4x32, so I was afraid it would last in other areas, but it\\'s still pretty speedy for the specs. Perfect for browsing and basic office work functions It sounds good. It works good. Only this is the Facebook APP crashes. But I can use the web browser for that and it feels better. Overall 5 stars. Great quality and worth the money. This is the perfect size for our kids to do school work, my husband to do his work. This is a great value, the screen is clear, lightweight computer, fast and easy to connect to wifi. Will be ordering more for my kids to do all their homeschool. Great Value It is so light and very easy to use. I am using it for work and it makes things so easy and fast to log in and get right to work. The screen is very clear and easy to see everything. It is great value for the money paid. Great value for the money, light weight, everything you need in one computer. Great for work or play. Fast start up and shut down. If you’re looking for a computer that is light weight and can do it all this is it. I would definitely buy this again. Definitely worth it! Got this little bad boy for my 8 year old to participate in her online schooling and she\\'s totally thriller. Ideal for her and it\\'s intended use and then some. If I didn\\'t purchase it myself I wouldn\\'t have known it was renewed. Great product 😀 Great laptop and came like new. Everything is working great after many weeks. I am impressed and recommend it! Picture quality can be a little bit better and low memory it’s still great price for what I do with it I have had this laptop since September 22, 2021 everything is perfect except for when I am using my laptop camera to make content it goes out randomly then come back up. Overall can mean my laptop is hacked possibly by the supplier or whomever. It is extremely nerve wracking simply because this is a refurbished product and you never know what type of creeps are watching you. Upon purchasing I will recommend getting it checked for bugs and making sure you’re not being watched. The packaging was very secured. The chromebook and charger feels and operate like new... i got it in a timely manner.. Do not hesitate to buy!! My favorite about this new computer is that now I can play games with my friends online! It also helps me with my art projects for inspiration and stuff. I was surprised how great this computer came out to be. My son uses it for homeschool. I definitely recommend it for as a student computer and to get the work done. Equipment in excellent condition Everything is fine, except the touch pad seems a little bit cranky, but for its price, it is definitely worth it Great value for the money, I was more than happy with the computer I received. It came in a very timely manner and was in good shape! very pleased, will definitely recommend. terms of service. apparently if u cant hit the agree to tos u r not gonna use the pc.\\ncouldnt load data.\\nfluke possibly but never chrome again. i love this product for its battery life I needed a new laptop for the upcoming semester and this one is exactly what I needed. It came in great condition and the speakers are amazing. Not to mention it is a great price. Absolutely love this product, looks just like the picture. Comes in great packaging. Works well for personal use or work. Over all I loved it👍🏼 I love this computer. It is very nice. Works great for being a year old. I purchased as a gift, I did not realize it was refurbished when I purchased. That being said, the overall computer works well for the purposes my husband needs it and he is enjoying it. Perfect for home schooling very nice computer. Light weight & beautiful clear screen. Great value & quality.\\nWould highly recommend.. Came out the box looking and performing brand new. Very easy set up and downloads. Got it for some class work. Great value for the price. Would buy it again. The HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students. It’s not a laptop. It’s basically a tablet with a keyboard. I read a bunch of reviews before buying but this model is older than the one I read about figuring it would all be relatively the same. It’s not. It’s a glorified tablet that MOST apps will not work on. I bought an external disc drive so I could load a program on to it but it’s not supported. That should be the chromebook slogan; This program is not supported. Should have paid for a real laptop. This is not a touchscreen chromebook. It served the purpose that I bought it for. For my son that will be attending high school. This is just the right size and weight. Works perfectly , battery holds for days . Great computer I’ve been using for work!! Very lightweight I would not know this was refurbished and pleasantly surprised. I am very happy with the purchase and price. Also, delivery was made in 3 days and packaging was tight. Very happy! Just like new money well spent I love their it’s pretty good for to be the price it is❤️ Performance is good for daily tasks.\\nPrice is very good with good design outlook. OMG!!! I absolutely L O V E this computer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so easy to set up and so light weight. I am borderline OBSESSED Works perfectly. Lightweight and fast. If your wifi disconnects after you close your laptop turn sleep mode off so when it closes the wifi still stays connected. I love this computer. It is a great buy. It was very easy to set up. It a gift for me 10 year old. Like new Laptop is very good. Delivery was speedy. I can recommend this vendor totally I needed a Chromebook for work and bought this one. So surprised at how good it actually is. Money well spent! Currently using product for school. Product is awesome. Satisfied customer!! I like it! The size is bigger than I thought. It was easy to set up. Perfect for what I need to do. Very happy with this computer, delivery was fast, which I needed. I would highly recommend this product. excellent quality price I am very pleased with this product. My son is a freshmen in college and this is perfect for him. This chromebook is awesome! It’s exactly what i was wanting. it really can not be used, without problems, Who does the refurbing anyway? While trying to input my password I noticed the E wasn’t working. After trying countless times, it simply would not work. Then after testing all the letters, I noticed the S and D also did not work. It’s obviously essential for all keys to work when using a laptop so this was extremely disappointing and I wouldn’t suggest you waste your money. Testing something so quick and essential such as the keyboard seems like a pretty logical thing to do before selling a refurbished product. It’s an external issue, should have been as easy fix and never released to be sold in such condition. Returning and purchasing with a different company. It operates very well, the screen is so clear and bright and the sound system is loud.. its really a great buy! Not a touch screen but a good laptop for the money. My kids love it. The computer is small and light weight. It’s perfect for my college student to carry around campus and use in class. Looks brand new, acts brand new great pc at a great price Worked great was what I wanted and was a great deal for the price. Easy to set up and use right away. Charges very fast,. It is also lightweight and slim. I liked the size and weight of the laptop. It’s easy to carry and easy to move. I really like the lap top..serves my purpose in retrieving all the information I need EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT, COMES IN A VERY WELL PROTECTED BOX, ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY IN COLOMBIA, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. EXCELLENT SELLER The person using this only gets on the internet. That is exactly what we needed. My daughter LOVED getting this for her bday. She uses it every day. light weight. good value, easy to use. Setting it up is a breeze. Highly recommend. I love this computer ! Great for the price. Great laptop, definitely would buy again, it starts up speedy, no lags! Terrific, powerful and a great size! This was a replacement for my 6 year-old chromebook. Love it! I really was impressed with the quality and the ram storage Very well packaged, excellent display quality. Not a single scratch, excellent condition of the product. Works great Great great value for the money! Just what I wanted. Good for work. Easy to use, good value The value for this laptop was all great spend on this Good quality. Great little starter computer for my son in college! This computer is great! So happy with this purchase. Perfect condition and works beautifully. good value, chrome os is very fast Excellent article Light weight, very good for price Good product and very prompt!!! Fast shipping nice product easy setup This chrome book is fast and streams videos quickly. I like it! It’s good! Good quality product Great laptop for the money Nice and lightweight I\\'m really starting to question Amazons refurbished junk yard. The quality is exactly that JUNK, dont waste your money buying or even considering buying returned /refurbished junk, ITS NOT WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY, AND AMAZON DONT GIVE A FLYING HOOT. Even new products from Amazon are failing as they are letting the slim in to sell you their junk inventory, and there isn\\'t a damn thing you can do about it. Don\\'t even get me started on 3rd party sellers, JUST STAY AWAY IS YOUR BEST BET. I bought 2 of them, the first one was ok, (keeping figures crossed that it stays that way) the second one refuse to come on, I\\'m currently traveling with a none functional chrome book, I would advise against buying this chrome book, you might get a busted one like I did. I contacted Amazon Support who sent me to the Manufacture Support who indicated there is nothing that can be done and I have to return the item for a refund. The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I\\'m sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware. Screen has lines in an it’s not touch screen an it’s like a 90’s computer but good for very basic laptop\\nI’m returning it need clear picture I received the laptop but cant use it as its asked as soon as i turned it on it asked for my bank/credit card details to purchase memory as its saying its reached memory limit...hmm how can that be as i only just switched it on?............not happy as i only purchased this laptop to talk to relatives on facebook living in england...def been ripped off folks :( The laptop looks nice but the keyboard doesn’t work. Don’t waste your money. This is not the one for me. Decided I don\\'t like Chromebook and went back to my windows laptop. I had to return it and Amazon made it amazingly easy. Cheap, bare minimum, almost not worth it. Save frustration. Just buy an unused, brand-new computer. The money is better spent This computer was exactly what I needed for work. Great price and does what I need it to. i carry it wherever i go, it is the best laptop i have ever used This Chromebook is really fast, easy to navigate. Excellent battery life. I can add more users, no more small phone screen for all my apps. Can used anywhere, it\\'s like carrying a small notebook. Really amazing with the unit and the fast delivery. Works great For now, I don\\'t see a thing that makes me dislike this laptop , I love the color,it\\'s slim, light to carry so far it\\'s perfect for me.I only use it for browsing, Netflix and you tube. I have an old printer espon and it wasn\\'t up dated on the espon app. I would reconmend this computer to anyone. it does what i need it to do. This Product is a Great Product, however the internet drops whenever i use Microsoft Teams Doesn’t support enough apps in the play store, but for the price it does what the bare minimum of what a laptop needs to do. Overall, it’s a decent laptop for the price it offers, wasn’t what I was expecting though I’ve had no issues with it and the battery lasts all day for me. I bought it for college. It doesn’t have a backlit keyboard but everything else is excellent on it. Love this laptop its my first and its worth every penny ❤ my laptop looks brand new I am in love with the final product I recieved. The device i slightweight and compact and does exactly what I need it to do. I did receive the product late but I\\'m certain that was a postal issue. Great product from a great company, I highly recommend this product for a student or teacher who is looking for a good work horse computer. :) Great buy. I purchased this for my son and he loves it. It is great value for the money. Looks and feels brand new, no visible imperfections close up or held at arms length. Screen is crisp, sound is clear and the webcam and mic works great I loved the product, it\\'s super good Light weight and a great value for the money. The package arrived beaten and the screen therefore broke. The guarantee allowed me the full refund of the money. You advertised this as a touch screen and it’s not! I got it for my elderly grandma and now it’s basically a faster version of the last laptop she had trouble using. If I wanted a good laptop I’d say it’s a good purchase but I paid for something else. I chose the wrong product. I would have preferred a pc with windows since I have never worked with a Chromebook with OS before. It has killed my production. I would love to exchange this unit for something that I am more familiar with. Nice! Great Brand New! No scratches or anything like \"Used\" mark. Work without problem and very fast! it\\'s okay ,it doesn\\'t have touch screen but could have one more usb port , Like new, that\\'s why I repeated I thought I was buying into a cheap laptop!! But NOPE! Works awesome and never let me down! really good chrome book... battery life is insanely good anywhere from 6-12 hours on a charge and the 1080p screen is great and it can play 4k youtube with no problem which is awesome!!!! really great condition also looked like it was never used... 5 stars!!! definitely recommend Works great I love it! Worked perfect out of the box. Was packaged well. Like the product and works well for what I needed. I bought this for my son is light weight has a decent amount of storage and will get the job done if using it for school. He is in high school so school papers it is good enough for. U will need a cord to hook to a printer. It\\'s a good product for school children,easy to control from parents end using family link works great & great price Would of been great to have touchscreen. The item was supreme and prime! Quality of the wrapping was rad. Immensely speedy delivery. Service was grand. It looks like a brand new product. Everything is perfect except the power button is not really responsive. 4 star for this product Easy to set up. Works great. Looks great. Great price. Happy with purchase. For what I paid and what I got it far exceeded my expectations. Lightweight with a long battery life . If you are looking for a notebook that delivers the HP 2020 Flagship has everything you are looking for . It shipped fast and arrived early. Looks brand new. No problems so far so good. Thanks! I have used it for about a month and a half, I have liked it a lot and it has exceeded my expectations. It is light, fast, easy to use, very good resolution. It connects to a WiFi easy. And fast, and also from my cell phone they link.\\nHonestly, I\\'m not very knowledgeable about new technologies, however, using Google documents as a word processor, power point presentations or videoconferences in meet or zoom has been very easy to use.\\nI can move it and take it on a trip, it weighs little, it\\'s a good size, like a professional notebook.\\nThe Mac type cover is aluminum.\\nI read some reviews since they always help me to decide my purchase, that\\'s why I did the same, I highly recommend it. I arrive perfectly packaged, earlier than expected.\\nThank you It arrived very well packaged due to its characteristics, it is a very well optimized Chromebook, in addition to the fact that aesthetically it is very beautiful, elegant and super thin, in the description it indicates that it has a Celeron processor but reviewing it it has a 4-core pentium N5030 and with its 4gb of ram It works perfectly for office automation, multimedia, video games, etc, you can edit your documents in Googledocs or office, the only thing is that in the description it says with Backlit keyboard and it is not, it has wifi 5 and 2.4, Bluetooth, the keyboard comes without the ñ but It\\'s not a problem, you just use Alt+n on the extended us keyboard so as not to lose the configuration, a device that is worth a hundred for what you pay and although it is renovated, it comes with new aesthetics and functionality and with updates until June 2026, I consider you can do a little more with this laptop going from the average user, fully recommended for office work, school and video games. Excellent buy!!! Perfect function!\\nAmazon you are the best! I asked for a smaller lap and you gave me a bigger one!! The tears in my daughter\\'s eyes upon receiving her gift are priceless! It broke my expectations, I expected something of lower quality but it is an excellent tool. It is very worth it. Chromebooks are really good products.\\nThis one has a fast startup, like rocket fast compared to windows 10.\\nlong battery life.\\nrecommended product\\n\\nThis is the second submission of this review after the first submission was rejected by amazon for not meeting guidelines. Almost unbelievable. I bought this article for homeschool for one of my children, the chromebook is super practical and easy to handle for children, ideal for home school! I loved! Perfect for my son\\'s online classes It is very light, the sound is very good, the image is very sharp, the keyboard is in English, but it is super fast, I love it. Price - quality ratio, it is excellent, super fast and I use it to create documents and teach online classes, it comes in handy Excellent and arrived before the indicated date🔥 Good product, excellent sound, does not weigh much, I arrive earlier than expected. I quite liked it. I liked the quality also that the specifications that come in the product are the real ones. easy to use and complements my daughter\\'s study Light, easy to use, excellent value for money. Wonderful. A very good computer for a very affordable price I loved Excellent product, good quality, good price I loved the color and the value for money It is very light and practical! I loved!'"

       "'i do audio work for video games creating sfx in a daw digital audio workstation and or composing midi mockup scores using kontakt and a ton of heavy ram use orchestral sample library the g ram on this and the tb ssd is a HUGE boon for audio work i use both ableton and reaper daw they load super snappy my kontakt heavy projects load ultra fast now versus the pc tower i was using which was still quite powerful the laptop runs fairly quiet even at heavier cpu loads i composed a piece of music for a game of thrones video game which ran about cpu on my other fastest computer the pc tower this hp laptop it clocks in at a cool so ive been able to have tons of cpu intense plugins such as ozone or reaktor running in the daw projects no problem i was able to turn the cpu down to in the windows power management panel and set the cooling to passive which causes the laptop to run slower but basically run silent because less heat generation which is perfect when i need to record foley or my own voice for use with creatures in the games i can then turn the cpu back up to full speed when composing or integrating the sound and music into the games the graphics card on this isnt the best but im still able to run unity and hook up sounds into d games that way without any lag via a k screen really this isnt a gaming pc only due to the level integration of its graphics card like you might not be able to easily run the latest greatest fps at full settings and stream on twitch at the same time without some drop in frame rate but who knows maybe u can i didnt test this fully but im confident you could still run just about any game regardless w tweaked setting most likely just as a test i loaded up one of my all time fav games skyrim and one of the heftier mods and it seemed to run amazingly well in k with all the game s graphics settings turned up i havent tried video capturing a game like that but with the right settings in obs i think it could work fine probably no more than fps id imagine i do do a lot of video capturing for my job getting animations and vfx clips to bring into the daw to make sound effects with and so far this laptop does not even blink w those basic vid cap tasks i also do photography and video editing on the side for my own projects photoshop runs like a total breeze on this ive never had a smoother photoshop experience personally after effects is fast to edit splice preview etc but some of the render times especially when using twixtor still take time a minute time stretched vector blend k video with color correction and film grain layers added took about hr to render so obvs not the best laptop out there for major video effects work but i think still totally doable and capable for those working more in the premiere type video editing layout arena my only complaint is that the laptop feels cheapo plastic this is my first non mac in a while so theres that so for work traveling which is why i ultimately got this i think ill need to get a good solid case and just treat this like a newborn baby during its life span with the crazy power of this thing given the requirements of my audio photoshop work i think this will be a super solid computer for me for the next years at least and for what a crazy steal I ve had this laptop for a week now which has been enough time for me to gauge my issues with it Speaker volume auto adjusts video footage provided I ve troubleshooted this through every process suggested online and can t seem to find a solution or explanation Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it ll cut to a lower volume and then stay there And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again it ll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume This happens exclusively with the speaker as in the headphones work just fine I ve turned off enhancements changed every setting in the control panel sound settings options sound settings uninstalled and reinstalled drivers uninstalled and reinstalled B O Nothing fixes the issue and it s very noticeable I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers the volume fluctuating is that noticeable Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it s hard to see regardless with heavy resistance Now I wouldn t mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing But in this case the keyboard does not have lit keys has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it s hard to make out what they keys are and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press Think of like a membrane keyboard but just a little more resistant than that Very clicky noisy too I could get used to it all but with the sound issue I mentioned above it doesn t feel so great bit color bit depth I do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use phone and computer monitor Then when I found that the display was set as a bit color bit depth I realized that this might be the reason why After searching all around online to see if this was changeable I ve concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself Not the best and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed And then here are some non issues that I ve faced as in things I ve been frustrated with but it s not that big of a deal It comes preloaded with Windows I just downloaded and did a fresh reboot with that Battery life isn t the greatest but I wasn t expecting much in that department So much bloatware but I guess that s more the fault of Microsoft than HP since Windows includes all kinds of useless crap that I spent roughly hours removing Everything else has been great If I can just get used to the keyboard the placement of every key and the weight of them and as long as I always use headphones or the volume problem magically fixes itself I might just seek specific support in regards to this then this seems like a purchase generally worth I ll just have to accept less than ideal color depth it s not that bad tbf I wouldn t mind spending a few hundred more to fix these issues and maybe have separate action keys that aren t the same as the function keys since I use those quite often I might consider that but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school which I know this will suffice for now This is by far the fastest laptop I have ever owned It starts up very quickly and shuts down quickly When you open an excel file the file opens before the click of the mouse fades away core processer GB of memory TB solid state drive Extended display with little display border Nice display Very thin and light The people who put in the upgrades must have used soft gloves because the computer did not have a scratch on it and started up as a brand new computer All for including tax is an incredible value I do agree with one reviewer that the letters on the key could be more white if color to see them easier but that is such a minor issue to all of the plusses If your current laptop has become sloe for you this is a great replacement at a more than reasonable price It worth Everything is great only the color of the keyboard is a little uncomfortable The Ryzen chip is very fast and there is no lag with the video response with the onboard Radeon graphics I m thrilled with the GB of RAM and the TB SSD It s an incredible little powerhouse and clearly with the price tag My only problem with the computer is the poor design of the keyboard Okay I knew going in that the keyboard wasn t BACKLIT but I never thought they would be STUPID enough to have BLACK keys with CHARCOAL LETTERING It makes it nearly impossible to use in low light environments I had to resort to propping a small flashlight against my head and shoulder to illuminate the keyboard adequately to see what I was typing I later ordered a USB LED light to provide the light source but really WHY NOT A BRIGHT WHITE LETTERING ON THE BLACK KEYES SMFH I bought this laptop for scientific computing and I was waiting for one with an core processor for parallelized computations When I saw a Ryzen core processor GB RAM and the price before tax it ticked This HP Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica the software I use for computations and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison At the same time the laptop does not consume much energy its power adapted is small I run a parallelized computation using all cores for hours and the laptop s body is only a little bit warm I do not hear any sound of the fan This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime On the other hand it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card no expensive Nvidia that I don t need Comparable gaming laptops cores on Amazon cost twice as much I haven t found any serious drawbacks yet A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within the body of this laptop and its keys are gray while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish With low light you don t see them well and you cannot work at night without a light The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop Intel i also energy efficient and overall good that has a black surface and keys white key inscriptions and keyboard illumination I like this HP Pavilion I ve owned several HP computers and printers before I m currently using an HP printer and this computer is the one I m now reviewing It works great I m able to type this review with no worries there have only been a few minor glitches all fixable by me So far at least HP has a lot of great support services in general and this hard drive is just under one terabyte they never seem to make it up to the full hard drive status they advertise And I m worried about defragmenting the drive it s a solid state drive and you can t really defragment a drive of that type without harming the machine Or the hard drive So I m hoping it will be okay and I can manage without using defragmentation services I ve had this computer for a couple of weeks now I paid about including tax CA Not a lot of computer makers offer a Ryzen U yet With MB of RAM and TB SSD it s almost a steal It doesn t offer frills like folding back the display touch screen or lighted keys But what I would have liked is Windows Professional instead of Home and School I made it dual boot and installed openSUSE Leap next to Windows The dual boot works fine However I haven t been successful yet getting the Ryzen to work at full resolution That s not HP s fault but rather AMD which doesn t provide its Radeon drivers as public domain Overall so far I m happy with this computer I hope it will last a long time Bought this for our son for college but hasn t been used much yet He seems pleased with it so far Mic doesn t pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera but it is faster than the Ryzen I murdered lighter weight too I thought I would miss my in screen but in is okay since the resolution is good laptop looks great screen is worderfull specs are great and gives power no backlite to see keyboard but overall laptop is great good quality and good value for money A laptop with excellent capacity games and programs run very well I can work comfortably without crashes I have had the laptop for a few days and I am pleased with what I have experienced thus far The body is rigid The performance speed is impressive I recommend it without hesitation It was nice to find this laptop with upgraded RAM I needed a new laptop for the graduate level I do mapping and basic photogrammetry so I ve just installed AutoCAD ReCap QGIS and Metashape So far everything has been running smoothly Although the fan begins to sound I think is normal Very cheap amazing laptop for work I use this laptop for coding and it is very efficient at the job It s amazing how a gb tb ssd core laptop can be this cheap The only thing I find a bit annoying is that I need to charge at least once a day for my job but I guess it is expected due to the high end requirements I purchased this in March Right away the unit was going to sleep an I could only wake it by using the power button to turn it off and on a star HP tech fixed that A couple of weks ago it started freezing and turning off After several hours on a bad phone connection they decided to send me a USB recovery drive which wiped Windows and all the applications After doing that and reloading the apps it started again This time it was shutting down because of Windows errors Finally Microsoft told me that it was no doubt a hardware issue but showed me how to reload Windows in a way that would keep my files and apps in place Told me that should fix it unless it is a hardware issue Didn t work I leave for an hour come back and it s re booted I m a small business man that relies on my computer HP s solution is to send me a postage paid box for me to pack the computer and send back to them so they can repair it Meantime I m left without a way to communicate with and service my customers I used to use HP inkjet printers They were good for about a year before dying I m through with HP Bought myself a nice Lenovo for a great price at Costco today Anybody wants a doorstop you can have one just pay the postage I am very satisfied with this product Quick Start Up thank for SSD drive Fast performance thank for Ryzen Great for multi task GB RAM Battery last for a long time Excellent equipment it is quite fast the screen resolution is very good aesthetically it is very beautiful super light in weight I use the laptop for PowerPoints projection Xcel etc Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great Not a single complaint Love it Very fast and loaded with all the Hp MS Windows Office tools to get up and running To fast and good quality I don t recommend this computer I am having lots of issues with connecting to WiFi at my house The old computers located in the same area as this new laptop are connecting as expected I work in a hybrid role and I need this laptop to be able to connect to WiFi wherever I am I guess I m going to have to take this to the shop since I m outside the return period Do not buy this computer from this seller You have been warned We ordered a unit with Win Pro bit We received Win Home will not work with our software so we sent it back THE FBA SELLER HAS NOT CALLED ME AS PROMISED BY AMAZON AND I AM UNABLE TO REACH THEM THE VIDEO CAMERA FOR ZOOMS DOESN T WORK AND THEY REVISED THE SOFTWARE BUT AMAZON IS SAYING TO CONTACT HP DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZING WAREHOUSE DEALS The computer is amazing however there are manufacturer issues and in order to resolve you have to downgrade your windows Thanks for the support during installation I love for the fact that its very fast monitor is super clear keyboard is good other than its lightweight and the price it very considerate It s a awesome Truly appreciated I am pleased with this one Bought it to do some development on and it s handling things nicely I use this laptop for programming and reverse engineering and it s so powerful I am currently running two text editors a terminal window and a browser with open tabs and everything works perfectly The machine boots in a second and launches applications even faster I m soo loving this PC I trade stocks and crypto so it works great for that I can send all my crypto into my cold wallet and not worry about it being lost on an exchange Arrived on time and safely packaged The outer box was heavily damaged but thanks to the good packing job there wasn t a dent or scratch on the actual packaging The laptop itself is pristine to the point I was doubtful of the claimed upgrades but everything checked out as advertised I wasn t sure how much difference I would see in speed but this is lightning fast and very responsive The touch pad and keyboard are crisp and smooth the display is excellent for The OS is Windows home and I m pleasantly surprised how decent it is Overall very pleased with the purchase so far I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen Turns out it was too good to be true That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download videos I watch or updates I complete They lied to most of us or they re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color It s great Better than my old one Great for the money spent Haven t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn t touchscreen However Customer Service and tech support is very good tech read many test and confirmed it wasn t touchscreen either but still this is not a touch screen They sent a replacement swiftly and still wasn t a touchscreen but they were fast paid shipping paid return paid freed pickup from home and quick refund Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed They shouldn t advertise it as touchscreen though I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for If you don t need touchscreen than this can be a great computer for you Looks like picture too Ive just received this laptop and its already running like it has hundreds of viruses slow af cant enjoy any games takes years to get to any website I gave up on deleting the hundreds of apps that are pre installed because how long it takes if youre looking to get a good laptop dont expect nothing good this cheap I guess Nothing is able to be saved on this computer I m returning it Recommend DI NOT BUY I love the color the screen looks great but it s too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished Very upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already While I was working it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere see pics It happened multiple times This last time the screen wouldn t come back and I had to turn off and turn on again Not reliable I had it for a week only I will be returning this I spent extra and got a brand new one Too risky Easy set up and love the color Great purchase Was a little scared at first to get but I m happy I did To replace a later hp laptop Needed something smaller More for ME Arrived like new Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid It is a great little laptop I love finding these great buys in the refurbished renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it s literally a steel At first it was taking forever mins and a blank screen to log in I was ready to take it back Then I tried to update and restart then it started up right away Hopefully this can handle my daughter s first year of college So far not bad for price The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great I love it It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer This was a great buy It s a keeper for sure Price can t be bet Great product Thanks Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill It came with Windows which seemed to work well Had no trouble with setup It is lightweight and for a refurbished item it looked brand new My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine It does not come with a CD DVD player I use flash drives to transfer data and programs A star buy Works great I got this a few months ago and it works fine the screen is tearing flickering but It was something I installed and not a hardware problem But it works as expected The machine itself seems pretty nice It is way faster than my old machine I was able to run two external monitors once I got the right cable I m not a gamer I just run a few business applications Get the bigger disk I got and should have gotten the larger disk because after updating windows with all its patches I only have about GB free BEWARE OF THIS SELLER I was very surprised to buy a new machine and find out when I got it that it was manufactured in and the HP warranty is already over I contacted the seller to see if they would pay to extend the warranty and got no response from them or Amazon Maybe buy this somewhere else or make sure you get a warranty included I needed a new laptop for gaming streaming etc I went with HP because my old HP laptop is years old and still works fairly well and that impressed me that I was getting something new that would last awhile But as always happens it had become frustratingly technically out of date for running some games and was also very slow due to low free memory This new model is tons more powerful and triple the memory I have yet to find a game I was unable to play on it and watching videos streams is mostly without flaw Battery life is not great I would imagine because of the amount of energy it needs to be as cool as it is This was not a deal breaker for me because I really wasn t getting it for portable use anyway so mine is always plugged in relatively minor issues I ve had should be noted The keyboard is backlit but this model turns off the backlighting after about seconds of you not typing As far as I m concerned that defeats the purpose of the feature in that it doesn t remain constantly lit in the dark There are no BIOS or other setting options to change this so it s a little annoying Secondly there seems to be a slight problem with the volume when watching movies off of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix At MAXIMUM speaker volume and MAXIMUM stream volume the sound is acceptable but you can t get it any higher than an average output It does NOT however have this problem when playing games so I dunno what s up with that I contacted HP about it but they ve never gotten back to me on it I ve found it to be a pretty minor annoyance though as if needs be I can still use my old laptop if I need to watch something at a louder volume All in all I m pretty happy with this model though I ll update this review if anything new good or bad comes up with it I decided to wait months of using it before offering my opinion and there you have it Laptop is great for gaming and streaming however the battery on it is TERRIBLE Unless it is plugged in I get maybe two hours of usage out of it and that s pushing it I would say closer to an hour even with the keyboard lights off and the brightness down Otherwise it s a good somewhat affordable gaming laptop Let me start by saying it IS a laptop I needed one to replace my aging laptop so that I could be up to speed since I am a college student so it needed to have storage capabilities speed and be able to handle various processes with a decent battery At moderate usage the battery usually lasts about hrs having multiple tabs open software compilers etc I strongly dislike MacAfee so I uninstalled that right off the bat and use a different antivirus This laptop is great for needing to be on the go since it is not large and it also sports Wifi and ethernet ports which can work in tandem with each other connect to both at the same time The RAM can also be upgraded which I plan to upgrade the GB stick to an GB stick at some point My biggest dislike is Windows This laptop is forcing me to develop new skills It is a huge departure from the Vista OS that took me forever to become comfortable with I bought this laptop to replace my old laptop because the Vista OS wasn t getting updates I primarily use the laptop as a storage device for images and music I am not a gamer other than The Solitaire Suite which I like very much on this computer I do surf the web and shop with the device also I can t comment on the battery life or the gaming capabilities of this laptop I really am not sure whether it is a good value I know it cost more than I expected considering it doesn t have a DVD burner or player I like and appreciate the upgraded Ram and Hard drive space compared to my old Laptop I really didn t want to buy a laptop that relied on the cloud as I use the device in areas where I don t have internet access Do I like it Yes I do ive seen people say that the battery life isn t good but I don t think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop the picture quality is ecxcellent the specs overall are great for under k its upgradable it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO with no use the light goes off all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they ll come back on im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked I actually prefer that to minimize battery use while using without gaming the battery life is actually pretty good so far ive played terraria and fallout and they both play great on ultra settings I think im going to install battlefield and see how it runs not a big fan of the game itself but that s the most resource intense game I own kinda curious how itll run the laptop is more than vr ready I love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing oh ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving mine didn t either YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY LOL oh and I also received the laptop within a day and a half ordered friday night and got it sunday overall I highly recommend Awesome laptop I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop The size is great it s in perfect condition I would highly recommend this And Pink I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do touch screen works perfectly This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I m very happy with it for the price light weight easy to use I m very satisfied Not a single scratch or issue Beautiful color also Very easy to use Quite fast Excellent for the money For the price it s a great deal I ve had it for about two months So far so good I don t use it for gaming or anything like that Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media I like the slim design of the HP Laptop Its very light no extra battery to replace Easy to do work on battery life is excellent so far Screen quality is great sound quality is also very nice I love mine The laptop is light and very sleek It doesn t run slow It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices I play games sometimes and it doesn t lag FYI No this is not touch screen The laptop came with the charger Delivery was prompt and the laptop was in excellent condition It was very easy to set up Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work Great laptop and a terrific price I am very pleased with my laptop As functional as it is beautiful exellent product good quality i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds A great buy I love the touch screen the most Lol but overall great investment The computer works just fine but I cant activate Windows due to no windows product key Low cost Works good Would buy again I received this laptop in great condition however it didn t come with a charging cable My only option was to return the entire thing get a replacement or buy a cord separately I didn t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included and I saw other customer photos that included it I m annoyed that I ll have to pay for one separately or go through the hassle or returning and recording it Love this computer Work great Love the color I didn t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised Easy to start up walks you right through start up Great price I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen Turns out it was too good to be true That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download videos I watch or updates I complete They lied to most of us or they re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color It s great Better than my old one Great for the money spent Haven t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn t touchscreen However Customer Service and tech support is very good tech read many test and confirmed it wasn t touchscreen either but still this is not a touch screen They sent a replacement swiftly and still wasn t a touchscreen but they were fast paid shipping paid return paid freed pickup from home and quick refund Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed They shouldn t advertise it as touchscreen though I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for If you don t need touchscreen than this can be a great computer for you Looks like picture too I love the color the screen looks great but it s too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished Very upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already While I was working it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere see pics It happened multiple times This last time the screen wouldn t come back and I had to turn off and turn on again Not reliable I had it for a week only I will be returning this I spent extra and got a brand new one Too risky Easy set up and love the color Great purchase Was a little scared at first to get but I m happy I did To replace a later hp laptop Needed something smaller More for ME Arrived like new Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid It is a great little laptop I love finding these great buys in the refurbished renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it s literally a steel At first it was taking forever mins and a blank screen to log in I was ready to take it back Then I tried to update and restart then it started up right away Hopefully this can handle my daughter s first year of college So far not bad for price The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great I love it It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer Not as easy as I expected Ideal for studies Perfect for traveling Wife loves the light weight and ease of use Fast on and off too You can t use anything Microsoft This one is not touch screen but for the price it s perfect and I am able do use it for what I need I love my laptop My wife uses it more than I do Lol Great little machine If you are old like me it s not great But kids use it for school work I used it as a backup in clinic when my computer froze and it worked perfectly Just make sure u use your bifocals I purchased two of these items both of them had the same display problem which when I opened up a web page everything looked fine then when I went into it like let s say Netflix it looked like x ray people like high contrast was on and it wasn t I opened up other web pages the same thing on two laptops I got the same thing I don t know if anybody else is experiencing this but I had to send them both back After thinking why would seperate laptops have the exact same problem I figured it out I had a contrast extension installed on my chrome web browser and once i removed it both laptops were fine So far thank you for a good purchase HP inch Chromebook is fast with quick bootup and is to easy to navigate with smooth touchpad Setting adjustments tune Chromebook to your liking and with app store at a touch of an icon many add on apps are available rear speakers give plenty of sound and wifi connection has not so far had any drop outs or lagging Chromebook was given as Christmas gift but stayed in house hold so will see how performance is going foreward I like the way HP does keyboards and touch pads and this product lives up to my expectations ChromeOS has come a long way since I last looked at it years or so ago This notebook has the ability to run Debian Linux in a chroot environment that has display access for GUI applications which is an enormous plus for me The MediaTek MT SoC runs very quickly and no lags or apparent memory shortage even with lots of tabs open The wifi radios are killer great speed and range It works for my needs and is very user friendly The seller was excellent Very timely and arrived well before projected date It s not a big laptop but it has been a really good one my kids have took right to it for school work Ive used it we haven t had one bad thing to say about it and the price was awesome Very good for myuse This is a glorified oversized cell phone Apps are okay but I cannot print off this as there are no drivers for my printer Also limited on what you can do with any software and mouse pad Save your money and just buy a laptop It s small and compact The screen display I thought would be clearer The battery life is great I can use it for almost days before putting it to charge it s just plain good dependable I bought this computer for schoolwork about a month ago and it works fabulous Especially for the price I would definitely recommend Its great for my yr old Great price for what u get It s a good laptop it s got an excellent price but figuring out how to work Chromebook is a bit sometimes beyond me Would be nice to have a larger keyboard and scree option However this gets the job done for what I need at the time Great buy Bought this for my son to use for the virtual school days and its almost perfect We ran into a slight hiccup because there s no windows button or caps lock key and he needs to know them for computer class Otherwise its perfect for Google classroom Does much more than I thought it would Will not accept some apps If you need a basic laptop to perform basic functions this is perfect Super compact and simple to use The cost is fantastic Perfect for my simple needs Purchased this for my mother to replace her year old HP laptop that was beginning to decline She loves it and finds it very easy to use especially being in her s and not very tech savvy Everything is very good except for the sound quality It is very low especially when I have a fan on I use a speaker or loud headphones with it Good for its price though This device is way to restrictive for what it allows you to see or install If you do not give google full access to all your information and locations it will not allow you to install some apps Heck it will not even show me a lot of apps to install The laptop ok but google has just put in to many road blocks to really make it useful This is my home laptop As I have a chrome book at work I am used to using them and appreciate that they seem better protected from hackers than most laptops If you want a fast fairly lightweight laptop at a really low price this is perfect I use it for email online shopping bill pay etc It doesn t have fancy bells and whistles but it s exactly what I needed The screen quality for me is bad it would not and will not register certain colors and decides to make them either teal or blue I can say the touch screen doesn t work because while I didn t know it was supposed to be toutch screen my family tried it and it never worked Still the battery life is decently good It can run most of the things I need hut because of the problems listed above not as well as I would want need All in all with its problems it has and the few positives in comparison I give it two out of five stars My older Chromebook was going to strip receiving updates last month so I needed to update my notebook I couldn t tell you how but while I was struggling with my printer and WiFi the Chromebook just magically downloaded everything from the old one too the new one Like I said I don t do tech the only thing is they were sitting on top of each other I use this computer for my business everyday it is fast and the battery life is amazing I bought for It is a light fast and great for laying in the bed Very fast This is about the th or th Chromebook in the family and happy so far Was looking for something something kids could abuse and also suitable for semi rough treatment at the beach camping etc Also wanted excellent battery life which this has non touch screen version typically hrs plus at about brightness Is very snappy with new processor Screen isn t the highest quality but better than expected at this price All plastic build but very sturdy and more compact than earlier models due to smaller bezels And it gets updates until June It s very important to note this is a Chromebook NOT a full sized laptop so this may be much smaller than expected Personally I love this Chromebook size and all It works great and has a pretty decent quality No issues with so far with charging battery life crashing etc I would only hope for a better sound quality as it doesn t get very loud at all Plenty of storage space for me as well as I use it for crafting Design Space app emails saving photos etc I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use Bought this to Homeschool my daughter and it works great Pleasantly surprised by how great the battery on this chromebook is I got it on a Saturday charged it to full battery then the next charge was a week after Granted I don t use it often just to go online for a bit and watch Disney but still that s a great battery life Highly recommend just for that alone lol Plus easy interface and controls An overall great buy on a Prime day Easy to use and set up chromebook Work s great good picture Awesome Better than a laptop this chromebook is so fast and easy to use I bought this laptop after seeing that it has a Touchscreen but it does not If anyone else wants a Touchscreen stay away from this Laptop The battery health is on point there wasn t anything that I disliked about it The features are amazing Loved this compact computer until out of no where it just stopped working Won t turn on Sits at a desk in my office no trauma was on and working stepped away then it was off and would not turn back on Pulled in not a battery issue The display is small and makes focusing on media for any prolonged period a difficult task The processor is quick and efficient and pages load quickly The sleek design offers and easy store and carry It s a get the job done chromebook without many luxuries I didn t realize how small it was however it s a nice laptop the screen did go black for a full day it was charged an everything for some weird reason it came back on that s the only issue I ve had with it took me awhile to figure it out but thanks to youtube got it done Very nice laptop This chromebook was perfect for my teens to do homework Beautiful I owned this laptop for a month when it stopped working After a few days of use it started glitching and the screen would freeze multiple times a day It would require needing to be restarted on a daily basis just so the laptop could become unfrozen Assuming I may just had a bad computer I reached out to the manufacture and they kindly offered to send a second laptop free of charge The second laptop turned out to be worse than the first however After having that second laptop for less than a month it also stopped working When looking at something with white in the web page there would be what can best be described as blue scratch marks all over the screen The company was nice but I would not buy another chromebook from hp again I previously owned a chromebook from Asus that cost half as much ish but yet it lasted me years I wasn t able to even get month out of BOTH of my hp chromebooks Now I bought the basic hp chromebook model without touchscreen It is possible that the touchscreen version of this laptop avoids these issues However I would recommend looking elsewhere Make sure you read the fine print I received my chromebook The package it was in was already opened A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok Plug it in to start using it and check it out Kept saying it was charging Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened So I decided to get some support Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did After nothing worked again They told me to contact the seller there was nothing else they could do to help me I reached out to the seller and got no reply And apparently I can t return it For any reason whatsoever So now I have a cr p laptop that I just wasted on that I guess I ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it So annoyed and disappointed I haven t even had it a few days and can t even return for a replacement or to get my money back Cool cool cool Thanks Easy setup and operation price was competitive and overall a good buy Is perfect This is perfect for what I need I am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet and it was just too small The USB spot on the side of the Laptop kept scratching my mouse and Flash drives and they would get stuck in there to the point it felt like if you were to pull it out with minimal strength it would snap I provided an image im not sure if you guys can see it very well but there are lines that were made from scratching on my flash drive Not only that but this laptop was completely useless to me it was recommended to me by an Amazon agent after telling him what i was looking for so i thought they couldn t possibly get it wrong but i was incorrect you can t even download anything on this laptop unless its from the play store it was the equivalent to my Samsung phone everything you could do on this you can do on a phone except a phone is better allows you to download certain files like exe which Chrome Operating systems don t If your looking for a chromebook to use the internet only then its perfect i experienced no lag with it but if you want more than that keep looking Got replica Chromebooks that my kids use at school Work great Laptops worked great Wow arrived earlier than expected Such a nice small laptop Already enjoying it Came quick good quality I liked everything about the product the packaging the product Everything came included there was no missing parts no nothing You so t waste ya time buying this This laptop is pretty nice works good it isn t touch screen but works perfectly for what i need it for screen quality is okay but no issues At first I liked I expected it to be a little bigger but it was small easy to carry and go on to go the touch screen never worked but I was okay with that the real problems came on like the th day after having it for one it does not charge unless it s all even when powered off it barely charged I d have it on the charger for over hours to get on there and only have the keyboard layout constantly changes on you to as though you ll have constant problems with your password and will end up having to use guest mode I do not suggest this product at all Lightweight and sleek great buy The only good thing about this computer was its size and weight Other then that it s better to just get an AO s which is about the same price but runs more programs It doesn t play any games and what it does has a smaller selection then the store on my Samsung phone You can t even jail break it to run Linux without really complex coding And even then it s highly iffy Overall just get a smart phone and skip this PC Works great I currently use it for college and this is definitely an affordable option for those looking for a high quality laptop Thank you The Chromebook is exactly what I needed and the shipping was super fast Would recommend this purchase Perfect for watching movies but wish the sound quality was better Also great for work Light compact and battery lasts a long time This version doesn t have a touch screen Worked well right out of the box Great battery life Nice computer The keyboard is smaller than I prefer but the functionality is perfect for my needs and budget Fast Delivery Great Laptop Super Satisfied Does everything we need Fast and efficient at a good price Very happy with this purchase Very light and too cheap for me I returned it I have another chromebook but the quality of this is subpar No comment but very useful Nice volume isn t very loud but functions and speeds are sufficient Love my laptop very fast connection and beautiful video quality Love it thank you good quality for price Not happy with this computer Great price and arrived on time However when I needed it to take my test to get my health and license license it was not compatible with their testing program I missed my exam that day Out of bucks Have to retake it again and pay more dollars Highly frustrated This was going to be my work computer but not anymore This chromebook is not near the quality of my Acer chromebook Popups are always coming up and the screen I m viewing changes without any warning or reason Also the screen is not nearly as sharply contrasting as the Acer My advise is to not buy this piece of cheaply made junk love it Love spending forever trying to download a chromebook recovery onto an old usb drive because it wouldn t boot at all New out of the box and everything And of course customer service just tells you to contact the manufacturer In all fairness after I had returned it I realized that it had been a refurbished item I didn t know that The return was easy Want a honest review Don t bother ordering the specs are not true and unless you just plan on going online to look at videos on YouTube I wouldn t waste your time This is not even a good starter laptop You can t run any type of software off here better off using your phone to go on YouTube The speed is slow and mine wouldn t even hold a battery charge Returned it Whenever you turn it on there is a loud noise coming out of it not sure why that is I guess it s ready to fall apart ordered two of these and both of them had green blotches on the screen saver and certain youtube videos This product was a Christmas present for my son He was so excited to get it Then come to find out it turns on but you can t see the screen Total bummer It will Be returning Don t buy WASTE OF MONEY Received this product used Previous owner had to remove the personalized name stickers but did not do a good job The HP logo has tons of scratches The track pad has scuff marks and the screen has a deep scratch I did not even bother turning it on RETURNING IT Had this computer for months Loved it Screen went black and never started up again Tried all the troubleshooter options Just never came back on It worked great at first Then it quit working after a short time Trash laptop the sound is running As described Quick delivery But we are an epidemic or pandemic sometimes it s handy to zoom with family and friends and I have been able to use it as a research tool I love this Hp Chromebook a it is great and it is adorable I absolutely love it it is great for work and school and games love it Chrome os and The laptop arrived earlier that expected I order it Sept and it arrived at Sept The item is also in good condition I will order again Thank you I love it will b back Hard to beat Most quality computer for the money Would buy again Perfect super great wrapped very good package and excellent my Baby boy loved his Christmas gift Very good For the price it s an exceptional computer I enjoy the simplicity of it being a chromebook I m a writer and don t require much It provides me everything I need The battery lasts quite awhile the screen is great quality and it s perfect size weight This is a great device We love it Best purchase Affordable easy access screen quality I really can t accurately rate this item it was a gift delivered to my son in another state What I can say it arrived quickly next day and son says it works good Super for the use that is required preparatory school Omg Better than I thought It is just right for me It came before time and it works great must buy Love this Chromebook Easy to use lightweight and easily portable Bought this to replace an old laptop Since I m retired I didn t need a lot of bells and whistles This does everything I need it to do Just be sure to check the compatibility list for printers on the HP Smart app before buying a new printer Do not depend on the printer descriptions I made that mistake I got this Chromebook specifically for learning Spanish while traveling or while at work It is durable and battery life is great The size is great for travel and does everything I need for what Im using it for Sound quality is good too If you need to plug headphones in you can My one beef with this laptop is the screen quality More expesnive laptop tend to have a nice white screen with brightness These chromebooks tend be made of cheaper material and have that horrid blue tint to them Not a fan The best price on the market There have been some recent notifications for those that own earlier Chromebooks that updates will discontinue as well as the suspension of the Google Web Store if you have an earlier model you can still use it but without Chromebook updates to the OS Thankfully HP and others have release newer models that utilize SD memory better when used with the standard memory in the Chromebook This particular model will share the gb SD card memory with the Google Play Store apps as well as allowing the user to dedicate memory specific to the Linux development environment If you had an earlier Chromebook configured in development mode and used Crouton with xfce you may have been disappointed with some of the quirks of the Linux desktop if you needed it for applications that weren t available from Google for your Chromebook such as RealVNC for remote desktop applications Thankfully the model allow for more memory for the Linux applications If you do choose to install the KDE desktop I couldn t get Crouton to work make sure you allocate gb rather than the suggested amount since the KDE desktop loads up several apps you may not need including LibreOffice The KDE desktop is very flakey to use but this Chromebook has a separate section for Linux apps that can be executed without loading KDE first without the need for learning a new GUI since this model utilizes virtual memory better between the two operating systems When installing RealVNC this app has to be installed through KDE using the def file through the terminal window Once executed through KDE the shortcut link to app resides in a the Linux app folder so that the separate Linux GUI no longer has to be executed first It took me several hours to figure out the features but it is more reliable for hybrid work environments than the earlier generations used If you use Office One Drive or Nextcloud these apps can be installed through the Google Play Store so that you can use them from your Chromebook as the app rather than through the Chrome web browser if you choose to do so If your phone doesn t have enough room for gaming apps no worries Many of the gaming apps can be downloaded from Google Play and execute from the Chromebook The battery life does last for hours and has better execution and performance than earlier models Like most Chromebooks it is lightweight and doesn t need a great deal of cables plugged into it It does work with Chromecast and is available as an option if the Chromebook sees any on the same network it is connected to This model works with OpenVPN too without file conversion by downloading the app from the Google Play Store and using the nonwindows config files to operate I recommend using the USB GB ethernet adapter from UGreen if you want to be a wired network Those who live in tech areas like Seattle the Bay Area or the the Willamette Valley should know that the best security is wired internet to prevent any snooping over wi fi There is no touchscreen on this model I like how easy it is to use I bought this for my daughter due to the pandemic she had to use it for virtual school and it is amazing for price I will definitely purchase again for my other kids Perfect for our kids when doing sch Another thing about this computer is you can download hundreds of Apps There is an App for EVERYTHING Also the port for the mouse was a little bit tight so I had to use a bit of pressure to plug it in but it works just fine This computer meets all my needs I can do everything on it that I did on my laptop The screen is great I can use my mouse and my printer I don t play games on it I can do word processing and spread sheets It is very fast It starts up in seconds and web pages load in seconds I have no complaints I love the waY it works and I love the way it do Nice little laptop for the price I m not very tech savvy but it works great for my streaming and stream labs as well at twitch and Netflix etc A small hiccup in shipping but contacted the seller at am and they got back to me at am Handled everything and we re super professional and nice Talk about costumer service Couldn t be happier Bought this for my son s th bday So far he loves it The Graphics are beautiful Would recommend Nice device But beware Only an American power connection for the socket is included and the keyboard is American i e qwerty and not like the German qwertz The device is therefore not so practical for children who need the device to learn A very good device I didn t like the American power supply cable Luckily I had a German ready works really well fast delivery arrived in excellent condition thank you Excellent for non design architecture or engineering students complies to be able to study Very good laptop it works and looks and feels of quality It is perfect for school work The battery lasts approximately to hours In terms of size I don t think it s small but not big either it s very comfortable to use and perfect for working on word processors It is a good option for basic and simple tasks as well as for social networks very practical to take anywhere I arrive before the estimated date perfectly packaged it is practical just what my daughter needed for her classes This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost It s a beautiful color and it has a clean look My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it s great for the price I m a writer and student and use non MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling I have a large desktop work computer where most of my work is done I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last but these laptops on average last abut years Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had G of RAM and the other had G of RAM This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the Windows S It is easy to get out of and there is a toggle to change the program to Windows Home which is more capable of evading corporate MS s iron handed ownership of my computer The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions It is just a matter of going into settings and changing it I do not mind the PC and MS marriage but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook This one is constantly asking begging me to turn on my Cloud service and turn on other MS Programs I do not do any of that and I do not want to send my work to the cloud When I import it into the big machine I will I like that it has an extra USB port Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook which I like but cannot use because of the non MS proprietary writing programs I use As far as using it for entertainment or videos the sound is nice and loud but not blasting the picture is great and it does not buffer endlessly but that may be my internet service My overall opinion is nice It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend on top of the line equipment Nope this is just a tuck it in the bag and go type computer Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose and homework The vaule is good for the money spent The one we got is not touch screen We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it but I restart it and then have no problems after that It is also good speed computer We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well Wasn t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability thank god when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that s what I ve been using it for I needed a PC just for internet browsing email and the like For just over delivered this PC fills the bill It may be a refurb but mine looks like new not a scratch or ding anywhere There s a camera but no touchscreen There s Windows it took about an hour to update the year old build It s fast enough for my purposes And it looks good too not nearly as pink as in the pictures This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials The computer operates great and has no issues Great product Excellent product touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop The size is great it s in perfect condition I would highly recommend this And Pink I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do touch screen works perfectly This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I m very happy with it for the price light weight easy to use I m very satisfied Not a single scratch or issue Beautiful color also Very easy to use Quite fast Excellent for the money For the price it s a great deal I ve had it for about two months So far so good I don t use it for gaming or anything like that Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media I like the slim design of the HP Laptop Its very light no extra battery to replace Easy to do work on battery life is excellent so far Screen quality is great sound quality is also very nice I love mine The laptop is light and very sleek It doesn t run slow It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices I play games sometimes and it doesn t lag FYI No this is not touch screen The laptop came with the charger Delivery was prompt and the laptop was in excellent condition It was very easy to set up Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work Great laptop and a terrific price I am very pleased with my laptop As functional as it is beautiful exellent product good quality i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds A great buy I love the touch screen the most Lol but overall great investment The computer works just fine but I cant activate Windows due to no windows product key Low cost Works good Would buy again I received this laptop in great condition however it didn t come with a charging cable My only option was to return the entire thing get a replacement or buy a cord separately I didn t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included and I saw other customer photos that included it I m annoyed that I ll have to pay for one separately or go through the hassle or returning and recording it Love this computer Work great Love the color I didn t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised Easy to start up walks you right through start up Great price I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen Turns out it was too good to be true That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download videos I watch or updates I complete They lied to most of us or they re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color It s great Better than my old one Great for the money spent Haven t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn t touchscreen However Customer Service and tech support is very good tech read many test and confirmed it wasn t touchscreen either but still this is not a touch screen They sent a replacement swiftly and still wasn t a touchscreen but they were fast paid shipping paid return paid freed pickup from home and quick refund Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed They shouldn t advertise it as touchscreen though I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for If you don t need touchscreen than this can be a great computer for you Looks like picture too Ive just received this laptop and its already running like it has hundreds of viruses slow af cant enjoy any games takes years to get to any website I gave up on deleting the hundreds of apps that are pre installed because how long it takes if youre looking to get a good laptop dont expect nothing good this cheap I guess Nothing is able to be saved on this computer I m returning it Recommend DI NOT BUY I love the color the screen looks great but it s too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished Very upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already While I was working it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere see pics It happened multiple times This last time the screen wouldn t come back and I had to turn off and turn on again Not reliable I had it for a week only I will be returning this I spent extra and got a brand new one Too risky Easy set up and love the color Great purchase Was a little scared at first to get but I m happy I did To replace a later hp laptop Needed something smaller More for ME Arrived like new Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid It is a great little laptop I love finding these great buys in the refurbished renewed shop This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it s literally a steel At first it was taking forever mins and a blank screen to log in I was ready to take it back Then I tried to update and restart then it started up right away Hopefully this can handle my daughter s first year of college So far not bad for price The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great I love it It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer This was a great buy It s a keeper for sure Price can t be bet Great product Thanks Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill It came with Windows which seemed to work well Had no trouble with setup It is lightweight and for a refurbished item it looked brand new My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine It does not come with a CD DVD player I use flash drives to transfer data and programs A star buy This doesn t have touch screen on my model The FHD display really surprised me It s better picture than a lot of these TVs As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later As soon as the th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it s got a burnt pixel No way to fix that without replacing the screen Unless you have burned out pixels good luck getting a return or any repairs HP is still shady in that regard I fully upgraded the machine when I got it GB ram TB Samsung SSD The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects I have a Geforce an octocore AMD CPU and GB DDR ram in my tower This laptop of course has a little less RAM but it plays games about just as well as on my tower I really am surprised at this The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a CM gap There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine but there just isn t room They couldn t even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately I had problems with HP in the past they screwed up a laptop return I sent in then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures so I m not shocked at how they treat customers I swore I d not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up It s super light weight The camera is nothing fancy in Windows you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options It s instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers You ll also want to get a good set of headphones The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out The machine simply wasn t designed properly and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a cm gap When you close the lid and open it after minutes you ll find it s incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI It forces you to keep the screen open which isn t good to have static screens I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat but there isn t anything I can do about it It isn t that bad but once you see something you can never unsee it I have a warranty but again it s not going to cover this damage so I spent money and not even days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen The case is the cheapest plastic they could find Given this was produced during the pandemic you re left with another problem Check your RAM speeds If you get stuck with a R chip you re basically having librarian trying to organize shelves whereas the good ram R would be equal to librarians keeping up with shelves Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine They don t mention this in their sales page or documentation and you ll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it or pull the machine apart Overall I probably wouldn t buy this machine again even though it works fast for an entry level computer It s just too poorly designed I give it a year or two before it fails Most likely knowing HP it will be minutes after the OEM warranty expires They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers and even though it s been nearly years since I swore I wouldn t buy another one they changed for the worse So this was the first non high end gaming laptop I ve ever purchased with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school work and general basic use To be quite honest it s surprisingly nice After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a display from my previous the screen is of good quality The processing speed is not disappointing at all The sound is great it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that I don t find Windows to be offensive to use Keyboard is friendly It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality not super cheap feeling It s light to carry Loads videos and webpages quickly No crashing or general use issues as of yet I ve even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it s running just fine I m really pleasantly surprised And coming from someone who is used to a k Alienware Gaming Laptop aka me the fact that I don t hate this thing is truly impressive enough If you pressed me to find something I don t love about it I d say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work I plugged it in and hit the power button only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it So I am not even mad No touch screen on my model And I can t attest to it s gaming abilities because well I have an Alienware for that Seriously though best spent ever Ok so overall this laptop is a decent practical all around laptop Not great but good enough If you re a deal hunter and are good at what you do I guarantee you can find better If you re like me don t have time to scout the internet and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation then it s possible at some point you re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you ll accept only being reasonably happy with it aka I settled Here is my observation of each aspect of the laptop The screen quality is good but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough so I m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment The battery life is ok lasting me about hours currently We will see how long that keeps up as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about years The keys feel good to type on which I was relieved to find The speed of the laptop is only alright For an SSD I expected it to be faster This machine will stream video just fine but don t plan on doing any video editing or gaming The weight is actually very nice but that should be expected with such a small screen One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot which I like Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan but this computer does not need that I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm Lastly and unfortunately the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings But after doing so I realized it is not a software issue The problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough So in effect what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad That is fine when you re moving the cursor large distances across the screen but it means that fine small movements are difficult to achieve It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this Luckily I came up with a solution You will need to order a touchpad cover skin for They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface This worked well The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size Here are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks Fix screen settings right click on the desktop show more options AMD radeon software display reduce contrast to increase the brightness to Fix touchpad by searching for this on amazon CaseBuy MacBook Air Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skin cut it down to size and install it make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don t have any bubbles in it after you re done After you re done installing it you ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity Go to Windows settings bluetooth devices touchpad taps touchpad sensitivity high sensitivity That s all I ve got Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them I like how lightweight it is the ram is upgradeable so is the SSD drive I have always been partial to HP my last computers have been HP s I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too It drains the battery faster than I would like but it could be my settings I will keep you all posted Thank you Amazon Additional Findings A month in and this is what I discovered When I ordered this laptop I had two things in mind One is a backup computer for my desktop I use it for my entertainment system it is partly a backup Plex Server It works great by the way Two I wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to a coffee shop and do whatever as I enjoy my coffee outdoors No complaints so far I have since tweaked my battery settings and have literally increased my battery life by about times between recharges Go to YouTube and look up how to extend battery life on an HP Laptop and you will find helpful tips I have no heat problem what so ever some people have complained about that I upgraded the memory to gigs and it is fast as all get out So hence my rating stays a star Keep in mind it is made of plastic be gentle if you wish to upgrade on your own don t be a bull in a China shop Yes before you ask you can hook it up to a large monitor and close the lid it is in Windows settings when in doubt YouTube is my go to I hope this helps I am happy to answer questions if I can Understand what you are buying and how you want to use the product and have fun This laptop did surprise me The Ryzen mobile CPU is rather good and the GB of RAM that it comes with is more than sufficient if you only plan on doing simple tasks office work watching videos on video websites etc I was surprised to see next to no bloatware on my machine though this could be due to the fact they do only give you a GB SSD There is an expansion slot for a SD Micro SD card but the laptop does have an additional slot for another stick of RAM and you can swap out the included SSD with an upgraded one provided you know how to do it or know someone that can do it If you upgrade to GB of RAM for dual channel mode and get a high performant SSD then you get a lot more performance since Ryzen processors often work better with dual channel memory This is essential if you want to do any medium gaming on this laptop I upgraded mine and I love it even more this is a good cheap laptop for doing various activities however gaming is a very poor experience on this laptop i dont know why it is marketed for gaming as it can barely hit frames at on most games i assume you could run some very light indie games or super well optimised games on it but anything that requires any kind of gpu power forget about it i will still give stars tho because it does everything i need it to and does it well good battery life i usually get at least hours of use out of it per charge Needed a new laptop and this was just what I needed Easy to set up and it loads quickly Excellent performance for daily tasks banks online procedures downloading and editing files etc Great contribution of bluetooth connectivity excellent wifi speed Very fast in everything Great price for this purchase Satisfied customer Excellent team Practically everything they offer however does not have the Backlit keyboard as it says in the features for sale They should take care of that detail for the rest it is very fast I love the screen excellent quality and the battery lasts a long time If you plan on using this outside it may not be bright enough Bought this laptop specifically for school It s great and not so big that it doesn t fit on my desk that holds my work stuff This computer seems to work fine I thought from the photos it had an SD card reader but it just has a slot for one so I have to use a separate card reader The AMD Ryzen chip gives this laptop great performance and battery life Both the CPU and especially the built in GPU perform very well Also it really doesn t get hot nor draw much battery during operation A very good performing inexpensive laptop overall I bought this for my Nephew He likes it a lot but he is a writer and he had to install and pay for a word program I don t know why laptops don t offer something simple for writing purposes Other than that he is pleased with the laptop I m very happy with this laptop I ve had it like weeks now and I ve used it every single day It arrived very quickly It s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs homework web browsing to even some gaming I ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested but even just with the gb I ve been able to run some lower spec games Games like Sims city Bethesda games age of empires ALMOST everything I ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles Whether you re looking for a cheaper option for playing games don t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings a school laptop or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on this is a good contender for the price The only reasons I didn t give it stars are the external hardware is nothing fancy not bad quality just could be better the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast and the material the track pad is made of is not that great Other than that I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop EDIT I have had it for like months now I still love it and all of this still remains true I have played some better games on it as well such as Ready or Not and Arma Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions Arma runs like a charm of the time In single player you van even run on ultra graphics for an FPS trade off I run the CPU pretty hard sometimes and it does pretty well at keeping up The pannatalle brought a detail A bright spot that is noticeable when the background is dark The battery doesn t last more than four hours and it has a problem that I think is a configuration problem that doesn t let me place the accent I make the language adjustments I restart it and everything is fine After two minutes it returns with the same problem I feel disappointed I don t know how to request a change because I bought it from Venezuela I bought this for my granddaughter who is a Sophomore in high school because she is taking computer graphics courses She really likes it All good This is a great computer for the value and I am happy with the purchase but when the computer arrived it was missing the prong connector jack for the plug to outlet Please take note as I had to wait another two days and purchase this part I bought this laptop for my kids so they could do homework and it works really good No issues so far Pretty quick Exactly what I expected Perfect size and power for what I need Good looking unit too Seller was very accommodating too For what it is it s pretty good a ryzen with an SSD and a fhd screen for is honestly impressive I hate the fact that windows was installed by default so I moved to Fedora Linux as soon as I was to I haven t tried any gaming but I can confidently say it won t run much Definitely a better choice than a chromebook This may be the best option available for less than as of February It has decent battery life hours good performance it s portable and upgradable if you are skilled careful Perfect for a student or for business use You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse office work watch movies etc Be prepared to deal with Windows sigh and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU s and Windows brilliant fan control Overall I recommend it I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads However I am familiar with upgrading and repairs This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding I m happy thus far My only gripe is the screen The refresh rate is noticeably low with media viewing Netflix HP has a home run with the average non gaming user Just wanted a quick boot up and won t burn my legs laptop at a reasonable price Rips through all my programs with ease I am very satisfied I bought this for general use as well as photo editing I know there are more robust laptops and PC s out there but I didn t want to spend a ton This laptop is very good for the price It starts up quickly and handles apps with no problems I do not play games on it so I cannot tell you how it runs those I do have Lightroom and Photoshop on it and it handled those very well out of the box I did however add GB of RAM to the laptop and Lightroom and Photoshop do REALLY well now No issues whatsoever I didn t know how I d feel about the Ryzen processor but it does a fabulous job With the added memory I don t think there s anything this laptop won t handle Note If you are going to add RAM to this laptop BEWARE You have to remove the entire bottom panel including removing the glued on grip pads When you remove these they may or may not come off cleanly meaning they may not go back on the way they were without some glue or repair Just be extremely careful in removing them Easy to travel with Fast processor I loved everything about this laptop It was great until I went to turn it on the other day and though the light indicating it was starting up went on it quickly went off and it has not worked since Since it is a laptop I was advised it would be cheaper to buy a new one rather than fix this one Very disappointed Good specs for this mid level laptop Perfect for my kid heading off to college It has all that is needed except maybe an additional upgrade in RAM needed in the next year or two I never really take my laptop anywhere so I never really rely on it for on the go I ve bought this so I can run emulators on my laptop and the limit of this pc seems to be The ps emulator so everything before it should run fine That s for people that care about that but overall a solid Investment for me It s a basic laptop that you can use for work Comes with Windows and you then buy Office It s really lightweight almost exactly as light as the MacBook Air So if you don t want to spend a lot on a laptop and you only use it for basic stuff like Office YouTube and web surfing and you are not too finicky about specs then it s a great choice The AMD Ryzen is pretty fast kinda faster than Intel IMO We needed a computer that was light and portable for school This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for and we bought it and a additional stick of ram It works well performance is plenty But the Negative and why it doesn t get stars The feet are small starving it for air even when raising it the fan loves to spin up way too loud and waay to often A laptop cooler rectified this issue but for a low power laptop not impressed with the cooling Screens OK nothing special which that s this laptop top to bottom OK nothing special I d definitely but another but I might pull apart and check the thermal compound put some higher quality compound on it and see if it helps I gifted this for my daughter who is a gamer and builder Add another compatible GB RAM about and upgrade to a fast TB TB NVMe SSD I play Fallout with a mix of med to mostly high settings with no lag I wish the keys lit up The whole keyboard seems rickety and not very sturdy It will do for now but I regret not buying another MacBook I ended up returning it because it doesn t have an ethernet port I didn t know that not all computers have one It seemed like it would be a great computer for a casual user My grand son picked it out As suits well for UTC Its good for basic gaming but anything like vr or final fantasy will not be playable unless you take out the entire motherboard and get a new one so you might as well get a better more expensive laptop because thats gonna cost about the same My son wanted a gaming laptop for his birthday He enjoys Minecraft Roblox and some Steam games I didn t want to invest in a laptop built specifically for gaming quite yet but this had specs that I felt would work for his interests I also followed a reviewer s advice and instructions by the way that review deserves a gold medal to acquire and install another stick of RAM to bring it up to g Not gonna lie I narrowly avoided a heart attack while removing the bottom plate of the laptop but it really was a pretty easy process to give an upgrade that lets my son play the heavier Steam games without lag He is very happy and so is my wallet The equipment arrived in good condition and performs I wanted to give this Laptop starts but the battery life is no good In just mins I lose battery power even when it runs on balanced Overall a great and powerful little computer Lightweight and excellent screen quality Do I recommend buying Yes I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows as my desktop could not be upgraded So far for the budget price it was a good choice so I m not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows My opinion on Win is still out It s not touch screen but other then that decent and fast Good value for money works as described Good fast delivery I do shirt design and am a college student so I definitely use my computer a lot this computer functions well and is pretty fast The battery last me maybe hours and is very lightweight Speedy and powerful I can finally play Genshin Impact Great battery life and fast to update with a lot of storage The internet reception isn t very good on it though i had this laptop for few months let me tell you this laptop is the best bang for the buck when i first got it it had everything i needed in a laptop I got it for the main purpose to use it on the go when i am not at the office however after few months i started noticing that every time i turned it on the battery is dead which makes the laptop unusable especially for the purpose i got it for this week i made sure to charge it to and turned it off so it is ready to be used when i needed it in case of emergency to my surprise when i turned it on after few days the battery was at completely drained while the laptop was off Best priced laptop AMAZING battery life and quick charge You get everything you want in a simple but powerful computer without having to pay for the premium of a top brand name or the premium of an Intel Chip Thing works just fine one glitch is I have to often restart my laptop takes like seconds max to initially connect to my WiFi maybe an easy fix I d recommend this laptop I just want to know how to fix the reboot issue Highly recommend My son has been begging for a laptop for gaming and has a bday coming up big This laptop has good specs and we upgraded the ram to gb up to gb The hard drive can be upgraded up to tb The price is budget friendly This laptop runs steam and GTA without issues The only problem I have is that the processing is not as good with windows the rest of the PC is fine it s light it s ryzen I do realize that I needed a graphic card though I got this for school as an online college student and I love it So far I ve only had it a few days but it works great It runs fast I love that the keys are big and don t on them It s lightweight and the screen is a good size All and all I m very pleased Pro quick seems well built for the price value for money Cons no fingerprint reader I assume the IR camera replaces this but not my liking dim screen need to add extra stick of GB RAM to get all the performance off the CPU The idle cpu was quite high when I first got it Still is even after some tweaking perfect screen and my games work fine Produst was as expected but I ordered laptops and only one came with shipment Had to find out why and apparently warehouse only had one but there was no communication so daughter happy and other disappointed as we had to order a different one from another seller Refund was quick though Bought this to replace my last HP laptop that died So far I m impressed I am very pleased with this laptop overall I opted for the Windows version and find it to be what I wanted in this type of computer I find the lack in number of USB ports to be a downer but a quality USB hub I use UGREEN products will fix that shortfall I am adding additional memory to the unit my folly Recommend Excellent quality price Really good specs for a laptop I did purchase another stick of gb ram not too bad to install just be patient when removing bottom panel Cinebench score of which for a mobile processor is not bad Plan on using with an external monitor external keyboard external mouse for CPA business tax work Cheaper than buying a small form factor desktop Bought this for simple audio recording and it is amazing for that It is very snappy out of the box but I did upgrade it with another gig stick of ram for future proofing I would wholly suggest it for any type of workstation duties Everything came fine box was sealed and undamaged but when it was opened I notice this huge scratches at the back Somewhat displeased because I know this is a new system but now it feels like a used device So far I have had no problems The speed is good I have a second memory card that I haven t installed yet but will soon As fast as it is now I can only imagine how much better it will be Will give another update later I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen I d be lying if I said I don t miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake I thought it was a touchscreen it is not It s a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for So far so good Very sleek and light weight Love it Thanks Touch screen nice Just the right stuff for home and student This laptop is really good and fast I just upgraded the ram gb to gb crucial ram and also tb sss crucial Now this thing is butter Good to buy I had doubts about the AMD processor used to Intel for a long time but it is super fast the battery lasts several hours It is not touch but the colors of the screen are great It comes with Windows Great laptop for going back to school exactly what you need for a reasonable price I tried to like this laptop I love how lightweight it is and the screen is pretty good it gets bright enough The CPU is also very fast for everyday use and streaming videos However there are two issues I have encountered One the wifi reception is very poor I have another Lenovo Legion laptop that gets full wifi signal anywhere in the house even far away from the modem while this HP laptop gets very very weak signal if I am moderately far from the modem second issue this laptop gets too hot even while doing relatively minor tasks but the problem gets worse while it s plugged in the fans go crazy and both the laptop and the AC adapter overheat Overall I wouldn t recommend this laptop Battery life not as long as stated Laptop feels cheaper made thany last laptop Screen quality seems good Fast processor quality in materials well built Had a HP laptop and this one lacks some features but is smaller and lighter weight good display and keyboard As for as a laptop that is all it is The headphone jack stopped working after months The battery is meh it drains pretty quickly if the laptop is off or in sleep It takes forever to turn on I legitimately thought it was broken when I first received it because of that It also takes forever to come out of sleep The review mentioned a touch screen I don t think it has one If it does mine does not work It was amazing I loved how fast it was to set up a very cheap laptop for gaming Everything is good Really like it Very useful and maneuverable equipment comfortable to work Love it Very satisfied This laptop is amazing As you can see in the image the screen presents this problem and it is more visible when the background is white or light I have not used a lot this laptop and it started to present this problem for some reason This computer is complete TRAAASH Don t walk RUN Keeps restarting and black screen every mins DO NOT RECOMMEND HP needs to do better with their products This computer literally disconnects it s self from the internet every minutes and I m not even exaggerating In a hour day I experienced minutes of solid fast internet the rest of the time is just slow constantly buffering disconnecting and reconnecting I ve tried everything updated everything made sure no power saver is turning it off no metal is near the laptop and after extensive research I can t get anything close to answer because all the answers provided don t actually work I can t even check my email without it disconnecting times Trash absolute trash and I m certainly returning this worthless computer because what good is a computer for streaming if it can t stay connected Got this Working fine for a few weeks But then I started getting the blue screen of death Got a replacement computer through the great assistance from Prime Member s customer support Got the replacement today and brand new but during the setup I got that same blue screen message Moving on and away from HP and non Intel processors for a while Computer worked great then went to open it up and turn it on and it doesn t work days old the battery won t charge to full The laptop is fine but I m deducting a star because the keyboard is not backlit I own three very similar HP latptops purchased through Costco over the past two years The Costco laptops were Intel powered i and i machines with the same nits FHD screens SSDs and backlit keyboards This unit is very similar however it is AMD powered and the keyboard is not backlit I tried my best to ensure that it was however I could not confirm on the web So let me be the first to confirm it is not I needed a smaller computer My desktop took up too much space on my desk while working from home This laptop has been great I can put it away when not being used and put it in my bag and take it with me when traveling for work I would buy it again This was purchased for my daughter and she LOVES IT Fast and great features Thanks I m glad I tried this laptop It gave me an appreciation for my year old model that has more speed and memory I returned it knowing that I should buy at least an equivalent replacement I m not a gamer and I have spent hours fixing touch screen problems I bought it because it came without a touch screen and without enough gaming power I was looking for updated features but didn t find any Pretty much the same ol wrapped in pretty Windows screens The price was perfect for the quality The narrow margin anti glare screen is beautiful The camera doesn t support the Windows hello feature Start up is much slower than I expected Without the experience of higher end machines this is a great choice Good deal This is the first time I used an AMD processor and I m pleased Works great Love the light weight and awesome quality Better than dell Not a gaming laptop but that s not how it s sold Great for school and light work Got this for my daughter after all of the chromebooks in the house died It s the perfect size weight and has enough spec to run all of her games and schoolwork She loves it Good After seeing so many rough reviews I was a bit skeptical myself but no worries this laptop is lovely I m months in and currently typing up this review on it The keyboard is fantastic and satisfying The mousepad is super responsive and has even a left and right side that have different features Although the screen is not my favorite it still works well This computer performs magically but I do recommend installing extra ram onto this to rock its full potential Overall beastly computer take my word for it It is a very good quality price option with respect to the competition in laptops I was comparing many and this was undoubtedly the best As for the equipment it is a good assembly it arrived without problems and very well packaged The only thing that I could point out is that it gets quite hot and it could be uncomfortable to have it on your legs for example after a while It is exactly as described very fast very light easy to transport very good resolution I met my expectations It is a good lap it has a ryzen U for the price you are not going to find something better it has GB of ram which is single channel so with one more module you do dual channel the only downside I can give it is the brightness level of the screen outdoors and that the battery lasts but fair enough it s a good lap for the price you re not going to find something better I bought it for about in early March I ve only had this laptop a couple of days but I really like it I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop Ok a little update I do like this laptop a lot I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn t work right out of the box I m dumbfounded by these reviews The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself This device had a defective battery out of the box I didn t notice that until after a few days I contacted H P and they were great to work with They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good H P offered to replace the battery free but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop They weren t game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it Well being the kind of person I am I went to my favorite retailer Amazon ordered the proper battery replaced the dead one and now I have a great laptop with a good battery I would still give it a star review and recommend it to anyone This is a great improvement over my ancient Dell D Because it runs Microsoft Windows as the operating system the laptop requires about three minutes to start all of the basic services and processes before one can reasonably use it One issue when plugging in a USB thumb drive the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse did not function properly I purchased a powered USB hub to resolve this issue This laptop is being used by me for DAW Digital Audio Workshop with vocal recording for my music I also use it for video editing and rendering For my other computer needs I still use the Dell I ve been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference This is the fastest one I ve ever owned I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books This notebook is too great to use for just that Can t say enough good things about it This isn t compatible with the pricey HP Thunderbolt G dock Not sure why a chromebook is but HP to HP won t Also I bought this Amazon used and the warranty was activated and only had months left Product itself seems nice though i truly like did have one issue when starting to downloads origin for Sims but i found a forum from EA and fixed it It should ve already been installed and up to date as a gamer pc however it was used and i think cleared so anyway it was easy to fix once i researched I bought this for my private practice and it works great Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office Analogue Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it s not a new iPhone I am very happy with it It runs faster than I expected which was my biggest concern Very pleased with this product Wife has no complaints and computer functions quite well Great price Is a good pc to work and watching movies but not for playing games Nice laptop works as expected It forgets the internet easily if you leave your location and come back so keep your eye out for that Other than that there is not much to complain about I was expecting something more mettalic heavy but feels like a Asus talking about the body Otherwise performance is good Feels smooth and responsive I ve got the issue with the WiFi driver and Windows but fixed looking and searching on the web HP support didn t help me at all I didn t like that the keyboard is not backlight Also it gets very overheated fast All our programs are cloud hosted so we didn t need anything super powerful This laptop is actually overkill for accessing our web based program and Microsoft but we bought these for longevity over any i The i models just don t last as long and tend to get slow much sooner than this i model Dozens purchased no issues so far I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing I believe that the bloatware was interfering with it I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail It does work fine now The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long may explain in part the quick charging I am now completely satisfied I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop days ago including the no wifi reviews I actually thought that I wont get one of those but I did and since no one had said that HP has a fix I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance so far Well I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a way call HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp fix the issue once I was on wifi they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue and the laptop in general for a permanent wifi fix this all via the wifi connection and they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently so for now I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place Also after watching what the tech did remotely a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers But again we shouldnt have to do that last note I also have a year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member it has been bulletproof since day one I hope to do and say the same about this one in years minus this incident Honestly I know absolutely NOTHING about computers I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like that didn t even connect to the internet In senior year of high school we had chrome books and those were so simple to use When I got this computer it was intimidating and I struggled to figure it out BUT even without support of microsoft amazon or hp I was able to fix the error code myself The screen display is beautiful bright and perfect for me I can t wait to see how it does for my college courses and sims I recommend it It s a perfect size and VERY sleek girllllll or guy I won t discriminate lol I don t do a lot of gaming but it s great for Microsoft email and shopping The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are Until I learned where the end key was for instance I struggled to see it Still it s a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi this needs to be addressed I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck deal I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless I have had no such issues nor any other issues Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally I find I never have to wait on it to do anything It boots up faster than any previous PC I ve had Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it I use this HP Laptop for personal use as well as for my Prayer Group duties I maintain membership lists as well as other related lists I create ads for our events and send them via email to our rectory for insertion in the church s bulletin Our other HP Laptop has been in use for these purposes since Since my husband has been using the other laptop more frequently writing novels I decided to get one for myself This way I have access whenever I want it I fully expect this Laptop to serve me as well as the older one did LOL to the one star reviews from people who can t connect to Wi Fi or used to some other brand and can t figure out HP It s a computer You have to either know how to use it learn how to use it or buy support I ve had this computer for months and yes yesterday I couldn t connect to Wi Fi Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty I didn t Started reading the reviews But then I tried figuring out why my Wi Fi isn t connecting via my cell phone It took a while I learned a lot of computer innards and after successfully connecting to Wi Fi I m typing this review from it Wi Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program This laptop is great Superfast Pages load instantly something I wasn t used to with my previous laptops Plenty of space for all my stuff in the form of photos videos family trees and also my husband s business programs logs documents and files I m very happy we bought it so therefore star review Excellent performance My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me That said I bought it for my children to use so might not be a problem equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price Picked this up for my year old dad Very fast machine nice and light Trackpad clicking isnt as smooth as more expensive machines and keyboard feel is just ok Would totally get again if on sale When judging this laptop always keep the price in mind First the cons Is it a gaming computer No the graphics adapter isn t intended for that purpose Is the housing suitable for those e g children who toss around electronics without regard for their durability No it is cheap plastic Don t buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes The matte screen isn t the brightest The sound quality isn t immersive There is no optical drive Now the pros The price This is a laptop with Windows Even though the laptop isn t for gaming I have used Adobe cs software with no issues Premiere Pro Photoshop Audition Rendering video isn t super speedy but it isn t unreasonable I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs and didn t buy it for that purpose as I have another computer for it but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise Who should buy this laptop Anyone who wants a light weight computer for school travel or home on which they can use email stream video take notes browse the internet or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro As a sidenote I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog Google Chrome but I have not installed it If you do a lot of browsing and who doesn t then I would suggest looking at other browsers such as Vivaldi I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using so it is not specific to this laptop Great For this price this laptop is amazing I use this for gaming and college and it runs great Very durable and can run bigger games like sims and castlevania its light weight and the keys are large and easy to press comes with windows installed and its a fast booter and runs smooth perfect and will do the job Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn t hold a charge longer than minutes After five months the laptop won t work unless plugged in HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse Laptop looks new No scratches or marks Runs smoothly after three months I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse This is feedback from my Daughter who I had it sent to as a gift HP is typically good equipment The components and spec in the AD appear to be a solid unit for it s intended purpose I ll send an update upon hearing further information I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school I needed something quickly but I wanted quality I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes I am so happy with my purchase Setup was a breeze it took maybe minutes and maybe an extra for the updates The picture is crisp and clear it has great sound the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read I purchased the windows version and have no regrets I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in With the exception of heavy gaming I can t imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn t be able to do for work or for school I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it I just needed a computer for home use and this one fit the bill I bought it refurbished and I couldn t be happier Perfect condition and no issues It is light easy to use and install She bought it for my daughter for college and she loves it Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for Works well with Teams video quality is ok but I m not using it for gaming Only HMDI port which is kind of annoying when you d like to connect it to multiple monitors Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi which is inconvenient to put it mildly when you need to be online for work Other than that it s an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it s supposed to It is ideal for my step daughter s on line tutoring She absolutely loves it Perfect for my needs Got as a deal great value Would definitely buy again It s nice Had issues w it not staying connected to the WiFi though Had to tamper w the bios to get it to finally work Computer works well and seems a good value Enjoy Windows Had one glitch when it dropped internet and struggled to get reconnected Thought we might have either software or hardware issue Did finally get it back but normally it would be an easy reconnect just by finding a viable WiFi signal Not the case If it occurs again we ll deal with HP to see if we have a hardware issue reason for a star rating Otherwise it was easy to set up and connect with printer and monitor And it s really lightweight so easy to travel with in my backpack I purchased this to replace my year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing social media emailing photo retouching and Word powerpoint excel projects This HP is everything I needed and more Windows is much more user friendly than Windows The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal It starts up quick and holds a charge for at least hours Best of all it s lightweight and thin so traveling is a breeze Bonus it is bluetooth compatible so I can make answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room Another bonus numeric keypad The only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back lit keyboard but I m not sweating the small stuff i love the SSD and the I not too crazy about windows Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos exe But I love the computer especially the boot time seconds We bought this computer to replace one that was irredeemable It has an i Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i I am not sure why the speed has increased but we like it a whole lot better The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on hours a day This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters we do not search the web or receive e mails The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the year extended warranty which I was told included tech support We had a lot of problems with the last laptop and needed tech support which was only good for one year By the way it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft updated my windows and then the computer stopped working I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they updated my computer and asked if they would fix it They said they would be glad to fix it for a charge At that point I was loud and angry I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware You screwed up my computer and for you will fix it I said I would not pay such ransom ware money I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing They did and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the automatic update button I did just that and for years I loved my computer again An update to my review the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus for a restocking charge No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you A further update on my refund The seller Tech Deals Store is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack I have asked for a full refund and am awaiting their answer If I don t receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund If that doesn t work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam Further update Amazon gave me the back I hope I remember the name Tech Deals Store and never buy from these people again I don t have any issue with the screen display and no issue connecting to Microsoft account and store It worked right out of the box I just have to set up some things before the first use The keyboard could have a backlit display for use at night time tho The keyboard itself is a little bit confusing because it has so many buttons that are unnecessary people don t use that much of extra things that s on this keyboard The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho I am happy with it I don t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube I don t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience Everyone has their own preference The only suggestion I have is to buy your laptop directly from Amazon not from marketplace sellers If you need to customize your laptop specifications I suggest you buy from bestbuy and from the manufacturers Happy shopping Pro Good price Nice size easy to handle light weight good battery life Con Dull screen Not enough brightnrss If I knew this is how the screen is going to look I would have not purched this laptop This laptop is very responsive very fast i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy I find it sturdy The only problem with it is the keyboard without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit the letters are etched over silver keys very hard to read them I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop Other wise a very good laptop My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst and I m working remotely To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false I m able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues In my spare time I also do music using Soundtrap I plug a USB keyboard and microphone guitar interface into this laptop and I m able to create multi track songs My caps lock does have an indicator light that works and I have zero complaints or issues Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model I purchased mine in February of and the OS is Windows Home Actually I bought One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp The laptops are great and we have no complaints Let me preface this by saying I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have interviews I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for interviews using Microsoft office suite using my cricut and he found this computer for me It arrived in day and was easy to set up I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching The battery life is great it s light weight and is pretty fast when loading programs I have zero complaints There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn t know it came with one if it does so I ll try that and edit my review Overall I m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it I am still experimenting with this little girl but I am very pleased I do not game so didn t enter a comment Very smooth operation speedy I ve not used this version of Windows so taking my time to test drive newer applications BUT very pleased Would recommend Starts very fast good price I bought this for school to make digital art and animation It works well for those purposes but I ve honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games Pretty much everything from like PS era and before can run at high settings fairly stably I don t think it can even launch most newer triple A games so I haven t even tried This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there s a learning process I m using it to start working at home My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys It arrived in very good condition I got this laptop from the treasure truck I have been wanting a new laptop so it was perfect timing This laptop was really easy to get set up I haven t had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it s much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work It s not a touch screen which I really like I might use it for video games at some point but that s not my main priority with this laptop I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker disable the TPM and jettison Windows I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough It really should have an ethernet port too but at least it was cheap Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available The screen is bright and easy to view however the keypad is difficult to view unless you have light right on top of the computer The keys are labeled in silver with the overall keyboard also in silver I had to call in a professional I T person to set up the computer Windows created major problems for him and took him hours of research to solve the problems especially with the HP printer and he has been working with computers for over years I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account The computer works perfectly Very nice laptop at this price point No back light of course also no User Manual as far as I can tell Would buy it again This laptop is more for social Media app games etc It s good but very little memory and the screen resolution is poor Fast computer for college Clear screen My Kindle books are crystal clear Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it s too early to rate but so far I m very pleased It s very slim and lightweight The set up was super easy It boots up almost instantly The key board is easy to maneuver The built in mouse pad works extremely well The screen quality is very good the monitor is bright I only use it for basic things like email social media research on line shopping etc so it fits my needs perfectly The battery life is decent It came loaded with Windows which is great but unfortunately Windows is not compatible with my printer The trade off is that Windows is far superior to Windows in all other respects The test will be to see how long it all holds up I m optimistic though I m still learning how to use the features As far as I know it does not have a touch screen It has issues connecting to the internet wi fi after updating It does not have a place to connect an ethernet cable which I should have checked before buying It allows me to do what I need to do so far The brand makes very good products it works excellent but for the amount I ended up paying I would have preferred to buy a inch one since I was charged twice for imports One is charged by AMAZON at the time of purchase and you also pay the import fee to the FEDEX Mexico parcel service at the time of delivery I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one The screen is huge The processing apeed is okay too It s just that i m not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard The letters shift to the left because of the additional numbers on the right side Other than that it is very good quality laptop and I m satisfied qith it Sometimes when I write on social media E mails ect if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it Could be my fault Otherwise I like it My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money I love my new laptop It is fast and works really good So far I have not had any problems with the Laptop Media Tek MT WiFi ax adapter does not consistently start from the sleep mode Every to days it goes dead Same condition happens with both and GHz It can be recovered by completely powering off and turning it back on This might have to be done a couple of times The driver version is and is the current driver per HP s web page The laptop works OK with a Cat internet connection A UNI USB C to Ethernet adapter cable is required as well as a Cat cable direct to a router port An extra expense to keep it running This is a workaround till I can find time to work with HP I would like to install a new wi fi adapter We purchased this for my dad for Christmas It is his first ever laptop It s great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on He absolutely loves it I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books it s not built for gaming at all Very easy to set up Very nice I use this laptop for work especially spreadsheets and data every and I m very pleased with the quality I got this computer because I wanted an affordable pc after years of macs and hating their keyboard A couple things I have notice about this computer Keyboard and pad are nice good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark And to right click on the track pad still confuses me Screen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting Computer is a little flimsy when folding unfolding Windows I am actually pretty happy with Takes a little getting used to but I like the os Overall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for Only weeks into using it and all is good so far I ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences I think this will also be a good purchase I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews But I m glad that I did because my pc arrived early and in good quality I m in love And yes it s for gaming also because I played on it and it performed well If you re thinking about getting this DO IT Don t listen to these people most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it For what I need this is perfect I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great Watching a video the resolution is hd The camera quality is hd Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use Since it does not have a built in CD DVD player it is very light weight I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive Glad I bought this i bought it when from Treasure Truck i got very good discount i already use it for a while everything work very well so far love this laptop Excellent value for the price Had everything I needed tbh This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in I was not unhappy with my year old machine but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation and the battery needed replacement The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice I found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software I am still in the transfer process This is disappointing Great laptop plenty fast for home recording with no latency I ve had it for about months now with absolutely no issues it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user After some struggle now the laptop is usable support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support Average price more computer than needed for the person I gifted it to Look at the photo The lettering on the silver keyboard is so faint that you can t see the keys from many angles and in less than direct light Who thought up this disaster The computer arrived securely packaged It looks and performs just as advertised Although it doesn t have a touchscreen it performs well otherwise I needed thiz Enjoy the functions but no CD ROM everything worked just great was delivered to my us imaginary address then forwarded by our logistics company outside the us arrived safe and sound works so far so good knock knock The computer looks and feels sleek It s a powerful unit But it doesn t matter at all when windows has a fault that will endlessly disconnect the wireless network adapter inside the laptop itself If you can afford something newer or ever run windows for the time being I recommend that highly I m so pissed at this laptop I ve probably reset the network settings and restarted it times in months screen very good Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she s enjoying it immensely Had no issues Product was fine and shipping was quick I thought I had bought the right la too But the battery dies really fast Don t recommend it Needed a new one I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck But like many of the other reviews stated there is constantly issues with the WiFi Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep the next time I boot it up WiFi cannot be located Long story short I returned the damn thing I like it lighter then the old one It s fast it s easy to use and it was just as advertised This new computer was a Christmas gift for our daughter and it is perfect for her daily use My husband really likes this laptop With the clear screen And easy to use process He uses it everyday I ordered it with shipping to Honduras through a post office box in Miami and it arrived in perfect condition I loved it It s super fast Like it was easy to fire it up This was a Christmas present for my wire she was very happy with it Love it so far and very fast Fast shipping too Laptop did a system update that deleted the wifi drive Tried many options but cannot restore wifi Tried to restore to factory settings but now windows won t even open Did a google search an learned this is a popular problem many had with their laptops as well UPDATE Amazon support transferred me to HP since it is still under yr manufacture warranty After long calls and multiple attempts HP support was able to restore to factory settings I missed days of work lost records had to get my computer setup for work all over again I was told I could seek compensation I would have to send in a company letter head stating the amount of pay I lost After a week of calls from their supervisors who kept escalating the issue I got the end user He claimed there is no such thing as compensation and that all the previous supervisors lied to me I was offered a coupon for a future HP product I m going back to MAC It s a great laptop for the price Very good I bought this to replace my current i Dell which is years old It has slowed down considerably and it constantly loses its wifi connection At first about a year ago it would happen once or twice a week but now it happens every few minutes NOT my wifi All other devices work fine I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago and it only made it worse I need reliable WIFI for my job to attend Zoom and Teams meetings Out of the box I was impressed with this model s speed and connectivity But I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home it would not connect again It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished It s only a week old I m returning this and going back to Dell Thought this to be an ok mid priced unit Liked it at first Then it kept dropping off line The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting This happened about every minutes Two other computers in my house do not do that Internet is fine Sent it back as defective They deducted as a restocking fee FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE Do not buy this unit Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly Just about weeks after its April th delivery this computer booted up to a different interface and we could not get the system back to its normal function despite the many options shown on the screen including selecting the option to do a fresh install of windows system restore etc I am now left with a fancy shell of an inoperable device I thought we were getting a nice basic laptop for my senior mother It was nice for a few weeks then started having issues and eventually the option for wifi completely disappeared After hours troubleshooting with windows and it s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period I don t recommend this device It is flimsy which is a little expected considering price Also not a touch screen Overall I would not recommend this laptop I only used it a couple of days when I got up one morning and it wouldn t pick up any wifi networks I tried to find out why but there was nothing showing as to why it wouldn t find any networks So I had to once again break out my old outdated laptop While I was able to use it it was working OK The only issue I had with it was I was unable to unlock and move the taskbar When left clicking the taskbar only taskbar settings would show up with no option to unlock it I am waiting to see if Amazon HP will honor the warranty My laptop developed vertical lines less than months after i bought it Based on a test it was determinized that it was a hardware issue The laptop was not subject to abuse I am a year old granny that keeps my laptop in my home I do not carry my laptop around I will let you know if Amazon HP make it good Thanks Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it It had a second life used refurbished sticker affixed to it I looked up the serial number on HP s website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it months ago If you re interested in this laptop I d suggest you look for it elsewhere I can t trust Amazon to send a new unit Do not buy Within a month of purchasing the wireless adapter just suddenly stopped working and disappeared Upon further reading of the reviews of this computer apparently this is a common problem So save yourself the frustration and avoid buying this I m giving Amazon high marks for giving me the option to return it for a full refund without hassle This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working I ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it I m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out Set it up and then one day later it wouldn t identify the WiFi I tried network reset reset adapter but nothing worked Had to send it back Don t buy this one There is some problem with the WiFi adapter Barely two weeks after having received the laptop the wifi drivers are barely working The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections Yesterday no amount of restarts worked and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery Sending mines back Wifi function routinely disappears The fix is spending hours on the phone with hp while they completely wipe the laptop and reinstall everything Really handy AND since there s no ethernet port it s basically the most worthless laptop available Purchased brand new Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in There s also a fun bug in Windows that turns off the wifi by itself and won t let you turn it back unless you do a full power down I ve run all Windows updates Restarting the computer doesn t fix the issue Pretty bummed out that I ve only had this a few months and it s a complete lemon Not sure I ve had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before Laptop quality is pretty good The IPS panel pairs well with windows I would recommend going for the gb version as with all laptops gb of memory is not enough for most takes in As I have pointed that out This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in The system will consume about gbs of memory just being turned on and with the bios locked down The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows The I processor is surprisingly good Averaging only a decrease in performance against the I model Not suitable for gaming IMO But I would recommend to most pc users Power users will know this is not what they are looking for For price it s a fabulous deal The C unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for It had instability frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem they convinced me not to return it I had to leave the country for several months The problem persisted At some point HP installed Win surreptitiously This stopped my microsoft programs from working I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win and do not work in win I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows to win at no charge I did not accept In June just before the warranty expired I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business the first was in and I gave them a second chance HP is both inept and dishonest Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov th Box was never opened until Christmas morning Wife was thrilled Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken The laptop has no ethernet ports Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi Fi MT x and Bluetooth combo Supporting Gigabit data rate internal chipset I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn t connect I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point There s a lot to like about this laptop excellent processor good amount of ram so so SSD storage but a lot to dislike about it also No up gradable storage or ram no backlit keyboard gray on silver lettering on the keyboard no removable swap able battery it s internal I have used HP products for years and had my fair shape of issues with them but they have generally proven reliable This is the poorest implementation of a laptop I ve ever seen It s going back to Amazon for a full refund I have seen others with the same issues on HP s support site and it s a relatively new laptop What a waste of money time and effort HP if your going to integrate everything in a throwaway design at least make it reliable for few years I DO NOT recommend purchasing this for anyone I was lucky if you can call it that mine failed within a week of ownership Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over Start up was fast Everything is fast on this laptop Buy this one You won t regret it Very nice laptop It does what I need and was easy to get started with I am more than pleased with how easy it was transferring my files photos etc from my old laptop to this one Being a senior I am limited at times dealing with technology and since I keep all my records in a vault recovery of those files was critical for retaining my medical financial photo s etc it was important not to lose them My old laptop had zero memory available but I was able to link the use of both laptops and transfer my files with little effort at all Very happy with this purchase Ignore the bad reviews this is a very good laptop I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a new laptop I love the size It has everything I wanted except a touch screen which isn t important now that my granddaughter is older The speed is great and it has a key which I hadn t noticed until I received it It s very good the laptop works well and it kept well the only problem was the time taken to arrive more than a month the problem not from the seller but the company that you send the order in my country thanks amazon Great price for all the features Very fast and efficient responds well when scrolling down and back to top so far it is an excellent Laptop Got this for my year old son for school It works great fast picture is SUPER clear speakers were awesome It was an excellent price for everything that comes in this laptop All around its a good laptop Its fast and reliable However there is nearly zero gaming potential This thing only has go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem With all that said everything else is great Wife uses this for work and has done well so far waited a little bit before review to see how it would be and has been great Battery has been solid screen great and easy to use easy set up light weight and durable to an extent feels a little flimsy but it s a slim laptop shipping was fast great product so far Works perfectly love it Is fast and it was a great value for the money Styling is a very beautiful laptop and good for whatever I want to do with it but I m mostly studying with it And it was safely packaged It came in a big box though which may have been for safety but seemed wasteful It is th gen and it has no backlight keyboard hard to use at night Overall a very good laptop I am more than pleased with my new laptop It was more than I expected in a laptop This is my rd HP laptop and my first windows pc I bought it to replace a year old Windows HP Stream that I have kept up to date I will be using this mostly for web browsing and streaming video and can truly say I m amazed by just how much faster this is Video and sound quality is excellent and web pages load instantly I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new laptop for personal use My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition I mostly use it for work but have used it for some older games and it works well I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers Bought this over a year ago and love it Just bought a second one for my father and he s happy too Great price great machine and it s lightning fast I use it mostly for work so Microsoft a office products Some tv streaming Very satisfied and will recommend it to anyone Can t speak to battery life haven t tried using it for long period on battery Great for casual internet and streaming use Bought mainly as it came pre loaded with Windows This product met my expectations I use it to run software for my Laser Engraver i bought an external Docking device that allows me to have more USB ports and an Ethernet port as well as a few more Excellent notebook fast light the screen has a perfect resolution Easy setup Works perfect for wife s home business She uses MS Teams and Zoom often along with Office software The only thing that bugged me with initial setup is it forced the upgrade to Windows I don t have an issue with W just would have appreciated having the choice to upgrade right away or wait Other than that the Laptop itself seems to be working fine I bought this laptop for my husband for his th birthday His laptop was years old and was on it s last leg He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past years but this one is perfect The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers He plays word games and does puzzles explores websites he emails spends time on Facebook checks out his sports neighborhood stuff etc and if he wants to explore more he can It s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease It s perfect and the price was SO right Oh I also purchased the insurance plan just in case That too is a great deal and great idea in my opinion Stars My wife use it for every day work Is lite and easy to use Verry good laptop and not to expensive The shipment was fast Update It got stuck more times and won t connect to the wifi unless it is shut down will be returning unfortunately I bought this computer to replace a Toshiba laptop I ve had for years and is now dying on me I do like this computer and I ve only had one issue so far It got hung up and I had to shut it down and restart it to be able to reconnect to the wi fi Other than that it has been great It s fast and lightweight I use it primarily for note taking journaling and household tracking such as finances through word and excel and for those reasons I love it The camera is better than my old laptop but nothing stellar I have not tried to stream video or used sound yet so I can t comment on that Overall happy with my purchase so far as long as it doesn t have the issue with the wi fi again I love the touch screen Very good screen quality Easy set up SSD is great Fast internet connection Large inch screen Getting familiar with windows I think I got a good deal for black Friday specials on this computer Would have given stars but it keeps disconnecting and losing the wireless adapter The first time it completely disappeared from the system and I had to reload it from the HP site It was a pain to get it reloaded and connected The second time it disconnected from the wireless adapter but it was still on the system I restarted and it reconnected It s a significant inconvenience to not have wireless capabilities on a laptop Other than the wireless adapter issue the laptop is fast the screen is bright and clear and it performs as expected good buy Does what I need and for a great price from the Treasure Truck Like it great product for what I want to use it for This is a great laptop I love it After days trading with amazon com it s symbol showed up on the st app web page I realized that this is built with an advanced AI system Amazon has been collecting data concerning my buying habit for many years and it suggesting this and that beforehand But it will never be like human because human mind is many hued animal Great laptop for price Very good I had the exact same laptop but much older It was definitely time to upgrade to a new one HP is the only affordable laptop with a screen Have been very happy with this computer Works great so far Will say at least for what I expect from a computer I love the size of the screen Makes it great for work Have had no issues Poor contrast with keyboard keys Poor design by HP I would say Lots of people do not have excellent vision White on black would have been much better as shown on my hand held calculator Getting accustomed to Windows is another story for a later time opened and up and running in ten min Nice for the price For a great buy Even has Solid State drive I rarely ever use my computer anymore I forgot to update to win so instead of buying it just buy new My old Lenovo was very slow I swear they program it to slow down after years A great laptop well please It s incredibly fast and the inch screen is a joy Works fine Half of what it cost about years ago Great computer comes with MS word package Big screen Great sound speakers Very happy Wish it was a bit smaller but all in all I m much happier than the Chromebook I bought the year before Very fast long battery life The HD camera is great for streaming Great investment Easy to use Good size Happy so far with no complaints Decent laptop to do basic stuff not a good option for gaming or graphics Good for email basic internet browsing and some streaming It is a nice laptop The quality is good But it is not cheap I mainly use this computer for working at home and some internet browsing It is much faster than the laptop with an i processor and twice the ram than it replaced For general tasks that aren t too demanding it is a good affordable option This is a really nice laptop Windows not as friendly to users as or This unit has intermittent ethernet port causing really strange problems WiFi works fine I have had the laptop for less than months and it does not work well at all It will routinely disconnect from Wifi even when I am in the same room as the router I try to link my airpods to it using Bluetooth and they won t stay connected even though these airpods can connect to my work computer and my phone very easily without any problems Every so often when I turn the computer on I get a message saying that a heating fan is not spinning and that I would have to try turning on the computer later I like saving money and I don t need anything beyond the basics in a laptop but I would like a computer that can turn on stay connected to the internet and allow Bluetooth pairing without causing me consistent problems Do not buy this product Wow No backlit keyboard and that is NOT disclosed on the product page Cant see the keys Bought a monitor light bar Far better Screen is not lit well and the vibrance is terrible Works fine but the casing is defective and already falling apart Now the laptop cannot be closed HP technical support offered to have it shipped back for repairs and said they would return it within to business days Who can be without their laptop for weeks My son can t because he s taking online colleges classes Beware of Amazon Lightning deals You get what you pay for I did notike the fact that right in the middle of reading the news a porn sight popped up and my computer was locked down so I am returning it asap the lettering on the keyboard is barely legible no contrast silver on silver who designed this and thought it was good Delivered with box hanging open and damaged Want to return laptop and not sifters Cannot rely on laptop working correctly or for adequate amount of time Extra screen size nice screen quality Over all this is a very fine product It was time for me to replace my old laptop that I had for years It s easy to overuse them and wear them out I found that it s also cheaper to just replace it I always prefer Dell and HP products This is my rd HP and I love it I have a desktop at home and this is a great laptop that I can take on the go Has all the latest features and I am still learning everything but so far this was a great buy and it s super fast I like the size and the picture but windows is hard to use big learning curve wish it was more like xp just basic is all i need just trying to put a app on the desk top screen is hard no drag and place good performance for my non game use I use it for remote office work the larger screen is good for semi permanent setup I use a detached keyboard and mouse the key contrast is too light which is common with the sliver keycaps Computer for little surfing and really more than I need This computer is really nice and would recommend to anyone Seems to work fine I like the big screen and the ample SSD storage Wish the keyboard was lit otherwise it s perfect Thank you for a quality product and fast shipping First it s an HP I have come to trust HP for reliability and price It s a little slow for me because it only has GB of RAM which I knew when I bought it so I m not faulting them It has a SSD which is only what I buy now Boot time is faster and things run faster for me with a SSD Screen is excellent in size and display Only real issue I had was not with the product but with shipping Normally Amazon wraps the heck out of things but not this time I m glad HP had it securely packaged but Amazon put it in another box with absolutely no padding When I picked it up the inner box was just bouncing around inside Who knows what it endured on it s way Thankfully there doesn t seem to be any damage thanks to HP packing it well Highly recommend this laptop if you just need something to browse the internet and do some other tasks It s not a gaming computer so don t expect it to be All in all I m happy with this i bought this because i work from home it was very easy to set up it runs well good cpu speed for multitasking nice keys nice screen and surprisingly good speakers the biggest problem i have is the battery life it s advertised as an average hours but i started working hours ago with battery life and with battery saver on and performance settings chosen by windows i m sitting at wtf but if i choose best performance but then the text will be difficult to read and everything will just look horrible also there s not light indicator for the num lock button as there is for mute caps lock and power so when you pressing numbers on the right if you inadvertently press num lock you re not typing anything that can get annoying works great really needed this For the price this is a great laptop It s fast and responsive I would definitely recommend this to anyone The wide screen allows me to work with multiple windows making drag and drop easy The only thing that annoys me is that you need to use the Fn key to access F keys This works wonderfully for what I need it for It responds very fast and the pictures are sharp and clear The solid state memory has been a pleasant surprise as it s the first of its kind I have owned This seems to be a good computer fairly reasonably priced very light and thin Fast I m not sure yet about the battery I ve had one incident in which the notice came on that the battery was low Usually I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery This is the second one the first had a problem and had to be returned There was some confusion with HP and Amazon but Amazon came through for us However the return wasn t as smooth as most Amazon returns possibly because it was a computer It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don t shop at The silver keyboard is attractive but makes it hard to see This could be fixed by making the letters thicker therefore darker It is all in all a good machine Love it I need hot spot but it works really well I love the computer I like the laptop but the description is wrong on the site no back lit keyboard no finger touch log on it s working fine but false advertising as it s best it s like the reviews are for all the laptops like this model because it says on thing in the description only to not have it when it shows up Laptop operates at a good speed and is reliable Everything is fine accept for the fact that it doesn t have a backlit keyboard as advertised I will be contacting Amazon It s a good tool It was represented as a gaming laptop It s far from that but it is what it is The speed of the laptop is very good I have it with Windows it runs programs like photoshop and illustrator very well in the gaming part I would give it an out of gears does not run very well I have made several configurations but closes other games like Dragon Ball FighterZ run them just fine In terms of hardware it would have been more comfortable to have the power button at one of the two ends and not near the delete button in general it is a very good computer for work issues it is very good I have not yet investigated whether it works with windows hello at the moment it only allows me to login with a PIN it does not have a fingerprint option I bought this product to replace my old Dell Studio Laptop so I can work from home and perform multiple tasks simultaneously I was a Dell fan for many years and at first was hesitant to buy this HP Laptop but ultimately decided to go for ir since it offered me a brand new machine with the screen size that I was used to the latest software and processor generation available and more importantly a solid state drive At this price I could only get older used or refurbished laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer I waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I m glad I waited and found this one for under I ve been using this laptop for over months now and I have no complaints whatsoever Everything looks and works great fast startup and shutdown and it doesn t get hot after many hours of continuous use I bought a USB splitter and a lamp that I can place right over the keyboard and the lack of multiple USB ports and a back lit keyboard was solved Like screen size and speed Great value The screen is great But it arrived with nothing to plug it in for charging I had to find one from an old computer There is no touch screen or back up light Value for the money Light weight Very good Love this computer Ease of use and extremely fast Easy to use windows is set up a lot different than Very nice laptop Will do everything I need it to do very good computer Seems to work well with what I use it for but would have liked a built in disc drive and SD card slots This is not a touch screen I ve had it less than a week but so far all seems to be really good No complaints I ve had this laptop for about almost months Everything was going great until two nights ago when the laptop began to glitch The cursor is blinking overtime I have an extension mouse as well and I have to use that one in order to get to what I am trying to open The amount of money for this item and it s clutching I bought this for my business I figured I wouldn t have to purchase a new one for a while However this is not good I have had a inch HP for about a decade and was shamed into updating since it was running Windows That and I had loaded it down to the point it as sloooww Bought this newer version and very happy Not getting laughed at which is worth the price of admission I have only had this laptop for a week The start up is quick I was pleasantly surprised how fast it is and how quick it handles a lot of things at once Would highly recommend I love this laptop It works great and has been a great addition to my home office This product is for home use It s easy to hook up and has great features Delivery was earlier than projected which was a plus A great computer and all I hoped for I am very happy with the laptop It has been a struggle with learning windows I bought this product for college and I paid the amount which is really expensive I finally got it and I was so happy to get my new computer but it didn t even come with windows I paid dollars for a useless computer then I need to pay more just to get windows No thank you I sent it back and am waiting for a refund Very fast processing speed Great graphics So far just a month with it But the large screen the processing speed i love Light up keyboard would have been a great idea though seeing that I use this mostly at nights when i m home However no complaints I am very satisfied with my purchase Respect from Jamaica This is a nice little utility computer seems to have everything I need no touch screen but knew that ahead of time BUT HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way The forward facing camera while it appears to work just fine it is NOT an IR camera and therefore Windows can NOT log you in using the camera So for the next years every time I want to boot this laptop and use it I ll be typing in passwords and or PIN s Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP s literature Seems a bit twisted to come pre installed with Windows but then due to a cheap made in china camera Windows Hello Face feature is completely unsupported Would NOT buy this product again Ever This is my rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this A usable cam would not have cost them more And then to not be up front about this and kind of hide this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using Makes me wonder where else in their selection of hardware that they got equally CHEAP with to save a few pennies Nice size screen fast does everything I need This actually has no touch screen so cannot rate that part It is a good fast laptop and has good battery life Sold as having a backlit keyboard and it doesn t Overall operation is great But wish the keyboard lite up This is a misrepresentation of the product If I knew this would not have bought it Picture quality is great Its twice as fast as my other computer It has HD lots of storage This laptop is my personal computer It s so fast easy to read due to the large screen love the feel of the keyboard I love everything about it I purchased this laptop for a tech bootcamp and while I was excited to get it and am in love with the size the specs are different from what I got There isn t a backlit keyboard it doesn t have windows and the internet keeps dropping while I m in class etc I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me shipping info for a return I decided not to since I can update to Windows myself and then that s when the wifi started dropping randomly Amazon won t give me an option to talk to one of their reps and the seller is In my opinion find a better deal with less hassle Was easy to set up with no problems One of the best Laptop computers I have ever bought So far so good Love it this is my first laptop Bought this for myself and it was fine for about six months then the fan went out Right after buying it for myself I bought one for my mom Hers came straight out of the box with a fan problem and had to be returned to Amazon for a replacement With two instances of buying this laptop I ve had two fan malfunctions way before I should have expected any issues Seems to be a common problem Great price Exactly as described I like this computer easy to find and type numbers and letters Fast and easy to use Bought this laptop so I would work abroad for weeks For few days before trip worked fine Morning I am leaving at airport it crashes I could not even get to log in screen Kept receiving error messages So I get to Greece and spend days running around to stores to fix it Returning this piece of junk as soon as I get back to the US Nice sleek Long lasting battery Mostly Amazon shows facebook I liked it very good A great replacement Nice laptop Convenient fast and nice experience with Windows But the battery life is poor With a battery charged the battery is exhausted in about hours For routine daily use you pretty much have to leave the laptop plugged into the charger I previously wrote the above review I must change it I consider this laptop to be a REAL LEMON STAY AWAY While recognizing that Windows is yet another Microsoft upgrade it must be loaded with undocumented features i e bugs Seems that anything you try to do invariably brings up an offer for product purchase or requires a password Willing to battle through for the sake of trying a new IOS the fun started to increase exponentially when I tried to install HP Smart to use my all in one HP ENVY printer There is absolutely NO ACCESSIBLE HP support Everything you try leads to an offer to Chat with the HP Smart Agent All you can do there is respond to questions it asks When none of the questions apply to your problem DEAD END It s wonderful I did not discover that I could not install programs such as Google chrome or other independent programs or my church or local companies that I order items from Is there any way I can oder another more expensive laptop I have only used thjis for primarily to read some issues of oour newspaper that are not printed on sATURDAYS The battery does not hold charge Fully charged battery lost after minutes from unplugging The bottom of laptop gets really hot I would not recommend Will return due to the incredible amount of heat that it puts out Excessive heat shortens the life of electronics For the cost I expected better only thing missing is a CD Drive EVERYTHING WORKS WELL Great Laptop you get what you pay for Perfect It s a great laptop for the price and space Easy to set up Dependable product I love my hp lap top It is not a touch screen Took a little getting use To windows but I love it now Worth the money Use it a lot for home use Not business I am using this to replace my old laptop at Home This one is so much faster to boot up and perform any activity I had my friend help me pick it out because he s good at this kind of stuff I ve had the computer now a few weeks and I m well pleased with it The only thing I wished is that the screen was brighter and they should make the power button stand out more than the rest of the keys It s a little hard to find Next time I think I would like to get one where the keys light up But overall I think it s a lot of computer for the money Great This laptop is great for getting clerical work or simple tasks such as web based business or office products completed I d say the only real drawback is the screen quality It looks rather washed out but otherwise it works great for what I need it to do Great for work good for watching videos and naturally bad for video games with the exception simple pixel or old indie games It also doesn t have a SD card reader built in but you can get a usb adaptar for that If you are going to process a lot of data at one time such as large databases or many browser windows I suggest upgrading the RAM to or GB as the GB it comes with gets eaten up quickly It is a simple and inexpensive upgrade and HP made accessing it easy Just watch out for the hidden screws under the rubber grips Nice laptop for school Easy to use Very fast Good storage Lightweight Love the big screen I was thrilled to find this computer for our homeschool family It is working great This came with Windows S which seems fairly secure I have already upgraded to Windows S You can download apps only from the Microsoft store which is a disappointment The app store is very limited so you ll probably find that your favorite apps aren t there and cannot be loaded on your machine Apps like Google Earth Pro Google Earth banking and financial apps cannot be loaded You can remove the S but then you cannot put it back This chromebook laptop is great for what it costs The price tag reflects the chromebook s natural lack of sophisticated abilities but this laptop is great for students on the go The battery life is conducive to a faster paced schedule and lasts well into the day without a charge Easily customizable this computer is well worth its price Love it It was very nice looking the screen was large and clear And was very light Weight I ve only had it for month but the tablet was super easy to set up the keyboard is easy to use and super fast response The battery life is superb I use it for emails web surfing and its surprisingly good for watching movies TV and listening to music The Bluetooth is a big plus for me I use my earbuds and Bluetooth speaker So far so good I recommend virus protection It definitely is worth the MONEY Sleek and cost effective Battery life is great and super light weight Good for what I need it for but does have a habit of blacking out when in the middle of something Not sure why it does that I have had other Chromebooks that did the same thing It runs apps and can use Linux although that takes some setting up had to watch some videos to see what i could install overall a stable decent laptop for under bucks dont expect to play games on it though i use it mostly for web browsing and email Overall after I figured out how to get the touch pad activated I found it to be a really good PC I purchased this as I needed a light simple laptop to take with me when I travel I didnt need anything super fast or high dollar as I use my custom built desktop for that I ordered this knowing it was able to be returned I was surprised and very happy with what I got Package was well packed Simple Laptop and charging cable I charged it for a few hours and setup was a breeze Computer is nice light and works well The chrome OS is a little harder to setup and get where you want but its something you can GOOGLE If there is ANYTHING I can gripe about it is this The keyboard is in lower case and I doint like that Thats it If I already put a comment on this before my opinion hasn t changed any I bought a refurbished one but the company said it was new whatever it was in excellent condition I had no complaints on that It works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department I might have wished for USB ports but so far I have no reason to use them Apparently this true of any HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard and it wiii be a bear to replace I hope it has a very long life I got it at a good price the in house Linux was easy to set up that s one very important reason the GB disk space was important to me so I have no problem recommending this Chromebook I purchased this laptop for school work singing and podcasting I love it and give it a big ups My MacBook was giving me a hard time so I needed a new laptop fast for work that was cheap This exceeded my expectations It s great but for Google only This is a great laptop for the price however it s not touchscreen it s very light weight and easy for Travel purchased this chromebook in Sept of last year it came boxed with a notice inside saying they upgraded the resolution to a higher definition than originally suppose to have come with and boy did it show I m am a true believer in a chromebook it s fast easy to use and can do almost everything my hp windows laptop use to do the upgrades are fast and it notifies you when upgrade is available and all one needs to do is press the restart button and that s it I get my internet thru my lan line phone co which also provides a top notch anitvirus luv everything about this laptop Overall I love this computer If you re in need of a low budget laptop this is the product you want It s under and you can not beat it You don t have to download pay for Microsoft Word it comes with its own I love it I really do Thank You I decided to purchase this laptop after my desktop computer was annihilated from a windows update My desktop is currently up and running again although it s running slow so I figured having a backup of some sort where I can access important documents and whatnot is smart in case of emergencies i e work or school It s hard to believe this is a refurbished laptop because it runs so smoothly Definitely a worthy purchase so far Product showed up on time Looks like brand new This does everything I need it to do and was really inexpensive so I was a little skeptical on what type of product I was getting I normally buy Apple products but needed something quick on a low budget and this is perfect really like this affordable refurbished guy i take it every where with me instead of my lb laptop take it in the hot tub and in the pool really great great key board great screen maybe one less point for the track pad but still good great internet fast and ready to go as soon as you open the puppy up problems week in knock on wood gooooood Lightweight Great size I ve been using for awhile now and no issues I m happy with this purchase This was a gift I can t rate it but my granddaughter is very happy with it Love the device The unitmarrived quickly Took it out of the box and the first thing i noticed was it was very dirty the underside was covered in handprints and fingerprints Also noticed that it was not the same unit that was advertised One feature listed was a micro sd reade and this unit did nit have it The last item was it would not connect to a wifi network I did every diagnostic possible to inckude restting the device the router znd the modem and it would not accept the router key Every device i own is either refurbished or renewed and this was the first one i had any issues with Since tech support and other common sense troubleshooting items couldnt fix it i sent it back Love loves it Very productive at home and on the go Was honestly expecting a unit with dings or scratches or looking refurbished The only way you know it is refurbished is because it does not come in original packaging VERY happy with this purchase so far Would recommend to others Wanted to replace a very old MacBook used for browsing while watching TV etc Didn t need anything high end obviously Just something to online shop pay a few bills and watch YouTube Purchased the Chromebook without a lot of research Mostly price and reviews After several months of use there aren t any negatives other than a dead pixel or two Impressed with overall speed and ease of use Would purchase again I love how fast it is and how clear the images are and the battery life is long enough to not have to charge it constantly but when I do charge it it does so fast I got it for personal use and future school work so it s exactly what I was looking for Easy setup small and lightweight I had to return it because it had only one USB port Excellent quality of material Super long lasting battery Very easy to use I am totally satisfied with my purchase I do not regret doing it Not enough technical hardware like CD player and extra USB connections FAR to dependendent on the cloud for storage Wow did this ever get here fast Impressive speedy shipping and delivery Very satisfied with the product so far I ve only had it a day so time will tell overall on how well it runs Thank you My kids needed them for school These are great for the money Good buy I needed a cheaper laptop just for school purposes I wasn t expecting too much based of the reviews for more than a regular work laptop However this laptop is downplayed It can do a lot more and operates great The only issue I have is the screen flickering when it s about to die but you can clearly tell why This is not a touch screen This laptop is a great starter laptop Its small and light weight The picture is great The battery lasts forever Very happy with this purchase Good times Light weight seems to be pretty easy to use Has a long battery life and completely charges in an hour or I also like the fact it has a charging port on the left and right side of it Our organizations didn t have enough computers for everybody so I purchased my own to leave at school First I received a really good looking machine It made a seamless transition to every program I needed to get my work done A battery charge lasts nearly the entire week I feel I got a good value for the money I am so happy that I took chance to make this purchase It arrived quickly and in pristine condition Workd great saves the environment as well and the need I have to have school on the go Needed a laptop for school am happy I got it works perfectly light to carry around Lightweight great battery life The chromebook itself is fine but the usb charger was bent I did a chat w amazon and they said they were shipping me a charger but it has not arrived yet I emailed the seller and they said to order another charger and they would refund me No thanks Sounds risky Order the new again almost worked perfectly but if the seller would have taken a quick glance they would have seen the bent usb plug Still no charger has arrived Great chromebook though This Laptop only has ONE USB port I repeat ONE I run a small business and I need a USB port for printer and label printer so this doesn t cut it will return However overall it s a pretty good laptop For my son school clases Great product my son loves it It is very nice We can watch Netflix videos etc You have to adjust the position in order to see a good image My daughter couldn t install the game she wanted to play Sorry don t know why has to do something with the system It s really good for anything browser based but physically cannot download most apps and programs not even steam Had no idea that chrome books are not compatible with most apple and window programs If you want to have fun with a chrome book learn Linux I was skeptical to buy a laptop for such a low price but I took the risk and bought it I cannot express how glad I am that I went for it It came in perfect condition and it blew me away Its the best laptop ive owned thus far Its easy to use has beautiful screen quality and very lightweight Its perfect for not only school and work but I can also play games on the google play store so ive had a lot of fun with that Overall its sleek speedy and super easy to use All is good We have no complaints Great buy Love it Great laptop when it worked nice size and touch screen BUT battery stopped charging after month of using it purchased another charger but that didn t make any difference This laptop is ok for the price but it has a few flaws It does not have an HDMI port so you cannot use it for presentations It only has USB port so you cannot use a mouse and a jump drive or printer at the same time all must be wireless And the new style charger that is similar to a phone charger breaks easily But if you just strictly need it to get online and do online schooling it s fine Was a refurbished unit but works and looks like new Was a great price for as much as you get Battery life is about hours Way above my expectations this is the second h p chromebook Iv e had in the last five years They are perfect for storage transporting and taking up very little space Like the look and light weight I use it at home for everything from internet to streaming movies games and you tube This refurbished chromebook has no noticeable difference from my original new chromebook Everything about the computer is great but the touchpad is glitching and with think I m clicking it when I m not The space bar will also freak out I ve tried a factory reset and doing research about the setting but nothing works I don t wanna waste my money on a mouse because you cant completely disable to touchpad It really worked well for about two weeks The money was quickly refunded and I purchased a different one and have had no problem with it I needed a new computer to start college in the spring and was also on a budget Refurbished was good way to go for me and definitely couldn t beat the price I purchased the non touchscreen version I don t see that to be a necessary feature and I am very pleased with its performance battery life sleek design and light weight Highly recommend It a good little laptop Great price Low storage was immediately upgraded Love it and so easy to use Excellent It came the next day no issues It came charged Set up was easy You d never know it was refurbished My pic is to give you an idea how big the screen is Clear pictures Runs fast So happy with this buy I had to buy these for work in an emergency they arrived early and saved a messy situation The chrome books are in perfect shape work superbly and have long enough battery life for our needs Plus they are full HD models I wasn t expecting that at this price point I d definitely get the same models from the same sellers again if needed Its a basic Chromebook Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do Internet searching emails and can stream amazon video Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also For the money I think it was a great purchase It s good for price and work Very great I loved that it is a super light device it is perfect for the student at home or if you are passionate about working from home from social networks It is super thin and you can carry it in your shopper style bag wherever you go It s great works good It s definitely value for money GB is good enough for daily usage It is easy to use once you logged in It is the first chrome book that i have ever used It s easier than that i thought Size is good light to carry and slim which makes it looks good I didn t activate touch screen yet but seems like works good Satisfied I like everything about the Chrome It is a very fast computer There was no problem and i hookup to my wifi easily I was not sure I would like a Chromebook Quick start up Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate it s not that different from other formats You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card The only thing I can t do is a wireless connection to my printer Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day Thumbs up Works ok It is a used laptop I had my older laptop for last years and it come time to upgrade I did a research and with my needs of accomplish many tasks in browser I decided to purchase a Chromebook My order came without delay Chrome operation system include a lot of useful android applications I am very happy with my choice There s no touch screen features but it s lightweight and good price It looks new and is fast has a long battery life and is spot on what we needed Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use Can t beat the price for this level of computer We bought this product for my father in law as a gift He s a novice to say the least at technology and couldn t be more pleased with the product Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place I would definitely order from them again Fast for Chrome OS Small size and light weight for inch display Clear display quality Good sound of front pacing B O speakers Long battery Good keyboard and touchpad I loved it very good investment This computer arrived a couple of days late but looked brand new and was in perfect working order It s a great price so glad we found it Part of the review criteria says touch screen It s not a touch screen though or if it is that option isn t working Really solid Chromebook for the price This was the only laptop that was in my very minimal budget that was x instead of x so I was afraid it would last in other areas but it s still pretty speedy for the specs Perfect for browsing and basic office work functions It sounds good It works good Only this is the Facebook APP crashes But I can use the web browser for that and it feels better Overall stars Great quality and worth the money This is the perfect size for our kids to do school work my husband to do his work This is a great value the screen is clear lightweight computer fast and easy to connect to wifi Will

participate in her online schooling and she s totally thriller Ideal for her and it s intended use and then some If I didn t purchase it myself I wouldn t have known it was renewed Great product Great laptop and came like new Everything is working great after many weeks I am impressed and recommend it Picture quality can be a little bit better and low memory it s still great price for what I do with it I have had this laptop since September everything is perfect except for when I am using my laptop camera to make content it goes out randomly then come back up Overall can mean my laptop is hacked possibly by the supplier or whomever It is extremely nerve wracking simply because this is a refurbished product and you never know what type of creeps are watching you Upon purchasing I will recommend getting it checked for bugs and making sure you re not being watched The packaging was very secured The chromebook and charger feels and operate like new i got it in a timely manner Do not hesitate to buy My favorite about this new computer is that now I can play games with my friends online It also helps me with my art projects for inspiration and stuff I was surprised how great this computer came out to be My son uses it for homeschool I definitely recommend it for as a student computer and to get the work done Equipment in excellent condition Everything is fine except the touch pad seems a little bit cranky but for its price it is definitely worth it Great value for the money I was more than happy with the computer I received It came in a very timely manner and was in good shape very pleased will definitely recommend terms of service apparently if u cant hit the agree to tos u r not gonna use the pc couldnt load data fluke possibly but never chrome again i love this product for its battery life I needed a new laptop for the upcoming semester and this one is exactly what I needed It came in great condition and the speakers are amazing Not to mention it is a great price Absolutely love this product looks just like the picture Comes in great packaging Works well for personal use or work Over all I loved it I love this computer It is very nice Works great for being a year old I purchased as a gift I did not realize it was refurbished when I purchased That being said the overall computer works well for the purposes my husband needs it and he is enjoying it Perfect for home schooling very nice computer Light weight beautiful clear screen Great value quality Would highly recommend Came out the box looking and performing brand new Very easy set up and downloads Got it for some class work Great value for the price Would buy it again The HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop It can be used for researching online budgeting and finances games music and movies Shopping for anything needed for the entire family Taking classes on line or for homework for students It s not a laptop It s basically a tablet with a keyboard I read a bunch of reviews before buying but this model is older than the one I read about figuring it would all be relatively the same It s not It s a glorified tablet that MOST apps will not work on I bought an external disc drive so I could load a program on to it but it s not supported That should be the chromebook slogan This program is not supported Should have paid for a real laptop This is not a touchscreen chromebook It served the purpose that I bought it for For my son that will be attending high school This is just the right size and weight Works perfectly battery holds for days Great computer I ve been using for work Very lightweight I would not know this was refurbished and pleasantly surprised I am very happy with the purchase and price Also delivery was made in days and packaging was tight Very happy Just like new money well spent I love their it s pretty good for to be the price it is Performance is good for daily tasks Price is very good with good design outlook OMG I absolutely L O V E this computer It was so easy to set up and so light weight I am borderline OBSESSED Works perfectly Lightweight and fast If your wifi disconnects after you close your laptop

awesome Satisfied customer I like it The size is bigger than I thought It was easy to set up Perfect for what I need to do Very happy with this computer delivery was fast which I needed I would highly recommend this product excellent quality price I am very pleased with this product My son is a freshmen in college and this is perfect for him This chromebook is awesome It s exactly what i was wanting it really can not be used without problems Who does the refurbing anyway While trying to input my password I noticed the E wasn t working After trying countless times it simply would not work Then after testing all the letters I noticed the S and D also did not work It s obviously essential for all keys to work when using a laptop so this was extremely disappointing and I wouldn t suggest you waste your money Testing something so quick and essential such as the keyboard seems like a pretty logical thing to do before selling a refurbished product It s an external issue should have been as easy fix and never released to be sold in such condition Returning and purchasing with a different company It operates very well the screen is so clear and bright and the sound system is loud its really a great buy Not a touch screen but a good laptop for the money My kids love it The computer is small and light weight It s perfect for my college student to carry around campus and use in class Looks brand new acts brand new great pc at a great price Worked great was what I wanted and was a great deal for the price Easy to set up and use right away Charges very fast It is also lightweight

laptop was all great spend on this Good quality Great little starter computer for my son in college This computer is great So happy with this purchase Perfect condition and works beautifully good value chrome os is very fast Excellent article Light weight very good for price Good product and very prompt Fast shipping nice product easy setup This chrome book is fast and streams videos quickly I like it It s good Good quality product Great laptop for the money Nice and lightweight I m really starting to question Amazons refurbished junk yard The quality is exactly that JUNK dont waste your money buying or even considering buying returned refurbished junk ITS NOT WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND AMAZON DONT GIVE A FLYING HOOT Even new products from Amazon are failing as they are letting the slim in to sell you their junk inventory and there isn t a damn thing you can do about it Don t even get me started on rd party sellers JUST STAY AWAY IS YOUR BEST BET I bought of them the first one was ok keeping figures crossed that it stays that way the second one refuse to come on I m currently traveling with a none functional chrome book I would advise against buying this chrome book you might get a busted one like I did I contacted Amazon Support who sent me to the Manufacture Support who indicated there is nothing that can be done and I have to return the item for a refund The laptop was purchased renewed Be careful who you purchase from Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm return item immediately Such as logging in and out Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can I wish I would of Just a warning I m sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are Beware Screen has lines in an it s not touch screen an it s like a s computer but good for very basic laptop I m returning it need clear picture I received the laptop but cant use it as its asked as soon as i turned it on it asked for my bank credit card details to purchase memory as its saying its reached memory limit hmm how can that be as i only just switched it on not happy as i only purchased this laptop to talk to relatives on facebook living in england def been ripped off folks The laptop looks nice but the keyboard doesn t work Don t waste your money This is not the one for me Decided I don t like Chromebook and went back to my windows laptop I had to return it and Amazon made it amazingly easy Cheap bare minimum almost not worth it Save frustration Just buy an unused brand new computer The money is better spent This computer was exactly what I needed for work Great price and does what I need it to i carry it wherever i go it is the best laptop i have ever used This Chromebook is really fast easy to navigate Excellent battery life I can add more users no more small phone screen for all my apps Can used anywhere it s like carrying a small notebook Really amazing with the unit and the fast delivery Works great For now I don t see a thing that makes me dislike this laptop I love the color it s slim light to carry so far it s perfect for me I only use it for browsing Netflix and you tube I have an old printer espon and it wasn t up dated on the espon app I would reconmend this computer to anyone it does what i need it to do This Product is a Great Product however the internet drops whenever i use Microsoft Teams Doesn t support enough apps in the play store but for the price it does what the bare minimum of what a laptop needs to do Overall it s a decent laptop for the price it offers wasn t what I was expecting though I ve had no issues with it and the battery lasts all day for me I bought it for college It doesn t have a backlit keyboard but everything else is excellent on it Love this laptop its my first and its worth every penny my laptop looks brand new I am in love with the final product I recieved The device i slightweight and compact and does exactly what I need it to do I did receive the product late but I m certain that was a postal issue Great product from a great company I highly recommend this product for a student or teacher who is looking for a good work horse computer Great buy I purchased this for my son and he loves it It is great value for the money Looks and feels brand new no visible imperfections close up or held at arms length Screen is crisp sound is clear and the webcam and mic works great I loved the product it s super good Light weight and a great value for the money The package arrived beaten and the screen therefore broke The guarantee allowed me the full refund of the money You advertised this as a touch screen and it s not I got it for my elderly grandma and now it s basically a faster version of the last laptop she had trouble using If I wanted a good laptop I d say it s a good purchase but I paid for something else I chose the wrong product I would have preferred a pc with windows since I have never worked with a Chromebook with OS before It has killed my production I would love to exchange this unit for something that I am more familiar with Nice Great Brand New No scratches or anything like Used mark Work without problem and very fast it s okay it doesn t have touch screen but could have one more usb port Like new that s why I repeated I thought I was buying into a cheap laptop But NOPE Works awesome and never let me down really good chrome book battery life is insanely good anywhere from hours on a charge and the p screen is great and it can play k youtube with no problem which is awesome really great condition also looked like it was never used stars definitely recommend Works great I love it Worked perfect out of the box Was packaged well Like the product and works well for what I needed I bought this for my son is light weight has a decent amount of storage and will get the job done if using it for school He is in high school so school papers it is good enough for U will need a cord to hook to a printer It s a good product for school children easy to control from parents end using family link works great great price Would of been great to have touchscreen The item was supreme and prime Quality of the wrapping was rad Immensely speedy delivery Service was grand It looks like a brand new product Everything is perfect except the power button is not really responsive star for this product Easy to set up Works great Looks great Great price Happy with purchase For what I paid and what I got it far exceeded my expectations Lightweight with a long battery life If you are looking for a notebook that delivers the HP Flagship has everything you are looking for It shipped fast and arrived early Looks brand new No problems so far so good Thanks I have used it for about a month and a half I have liked it a lot and it has exceeded my expectations It is light fast easy to use very good resolution It connects to a WiFi easy And fast and also from my cell phone they link Honestly I m not very knowledgeable about new technologies however using Google documents as a word processor power point presentations or videoconferences in meet or zoom has been very easy to use I can move it and take it on a trip it weighs little it s a good size like a professional notebook The Mac type cover is aluminum I read some reviews since they always help me to decide my purchase that s why I did the same I highly recommend it I arrive perfectly packaged earlier than expected Thank you It arrived very well packaged due to its characteristics it is a very well optimized Chromebook in addition to the fact that aesthetically it is very beautiful elegant and super thin in the description it indicates that it has a Celeron processor but reviewing it it has a core pentium N and with its gb of ram It works perfectly for office automation multimedia video games etc you can edit your documents in Googledocs or office the only thing is that in the description it says with Backlit keyboard and it is not it has wifi and Bluetooth the keyboard comes without the but It s not a problem you just use Alt n on the extended us keyboard so as not to lose the configuration a device that is worth a hundred for what you pay and although it is renovated it comes with new aesthetics and functionality and with updates until June I consider you can do a little more with this laptop going from the average user fully recommended for office work school and video games Excellent buy Perfect function Amazon you are the best I asked for a smaller lap and you gave me a bigger one The tears in my daughter s eyes upon receiving her gift are priceless It broke my expectations I expected something of lower quality but it is an excellent tool It is very worth it Chromebooks are really good products This one has a fast startup like rocket fast compared to windows long battery life recommended product This is the second submission of this review after the first submission was rejected by amazon for not meeting guidelines Almost unbelievable I bought this article for homeschool for one of my children the chromebook is super practical and easy to handle for children ideal for home school I loved Perfect for my son s online classes It is very light the sound is very good the image is very sharp the keyboard is in English but it is super fast I love it Price quality ratio it is excellent super fast and I use it to create documents and teach online classes it comes in handy Excellent and arrived before the indicated date Good product excellent sound does not weigh much I arrive earlier than expected I quite liked it I liked the quality also that the specifications that come in the product are the real ones easy to use and complements my daughter s study Light easy to use excellent value for money Wonderful A very good computer for a very affordable price I loved Excellent product good quality good price I loved the color and the value for money It is very light and practical I loved'"

       "'It was running smooth for the first month or so I had it, and then randomly after booting up a certain steam game it would always randomly turn off the screen and leave the actual computer on. I couldn\\'t turn the screen back on I had to restart the whole laptop. It would happen about 3 times per actual game playing session. And then I noticed it was way slower when booting up after not being used for a while. It would sit on desktop and take 3 minutes to open either Spotify, steam, google, or anything. And today it gave me the blue screen of death. I never downloaded anything fishy, just steam games Spotify and then I browsed YouTube every now and then. I remember buying a laptop from bestbuy like 3 years ago for 400$ cad and it was almost as fast as this laptop which is 1400& cad. I mean the laptop worked again after I restarted it a few times, which is good. It still sorta works. But who knows how much worse it will get over time. Might just return it instead of getting a tech guy to fix it if I can. little expensive Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. It works , not too slow I liked this computer allot up until it just stopped working after 14 months. I purchased this computer for 2 purposes. First to work from home remotely during the pandemic and second to run CAD Software for my desktop CNC router. I did not use it for anything else and was extremely careful on what it was used for as well as kept it in emaculent condition. I also saved anything other than the necessary software on an external hard drive. After the 1 year manufacturers warranty expired the laptop would just freeze shortly after turning on and an error screen would show up. It forced me to restart the computer and the same thing would happen. I took it to two different IT experts both said there is something severely wrong with the hardware. They both tried everything they knew to fix the problem unsuccessfully. The computer is useless at this point. About 6 months after owning the computer very rarely the computer would freeze and would need to be restarted. This was so rare it wasn\\'t really an issue and would always work after being restarted until one day after owning for 14 months or just locked up and wouldn\\'t work. I factory reset it which was almost impossible given how it wouldn\\'t work but was able to. My IT coworker tried reinstalling the driver software from Nvidia and he did a bunch of things I am not knowledgeable on to discuss. Moral of the story buy another brand as I am because I no longer trust the quality of HP. Which is sad because I try to support American companies and try to buy American made or American owned when the prior is not an option. I was a Mac/apple guy but most CAD SOFTWARE requires windows so I bought this HP as my first PC in over 15 years. I am considering going back to Apple as some CAD companies have software that can be run using a Mac. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! Working to help other in need. I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow.

Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Affordable for working remotely Within a week of receiving this product, the touchpad would randomly stop working. After a while, it would start working again. This seemed to happen randomly with it working for hours then not working for hours. Since it was within the 30 days, I returned it for a full refund.\\n\\nHowever, the company stated that this touchpad is working find and only gave me a partial refund because of the restocking fee. After asking them if they looked only briefly or for a while, like my reason stated, they refused to even provide an answer. They only pointed towards Amazon customer service to ask for a full refund for me. Luckily, Amazon customer service covered the difference without any hassle.\\n\\nDon\\'t support SkyNetWorks. My excitement for getting a Chromebook to still study and write when I\\'m too sick/tired to sit up was dampened considerably when this got here.\\n\\nBasically, something is wrong with the screen. Not just in this one - the issue is still present even in the replacement that Amazon sent. It seems to have a problem with skin in particular, along with pale colors, and using the built-in \"night light\" feature or Screen Shader extension on Chrome to reduce blue light makes it worse. When watching videos, people will commonly have huge blotches of green pixels along their skin. And in normal windows, green lines and splotches will often appear for no reason at all.\\n\\nInitially I tried talking to HP Support about the issue, and they actually tried to foist me off on a \"specialist\" that I would have to pay for - to get help on a brand new Chromebook that I hadn\\'t even had for an hour yet! Thankfully Amazon support was more reasonable, and they simply offered to set up a return and send me a replacement in the meantime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue is persisting even in the replacement. I can only assume it\\'s a common defect in this model now, maybe in some awful push to try and get people to buy the newer and more expensive one. Don\\'t waste your money or time - get a different Chromebook, from a different brand! UPDATE: so I returned the first one. Which I paid only $90 for it. Reordered another one; then got charged $119 plus tax for it, it still has not been shipped. Just looked at them again and now they’re asking $129 plus tax. Is this a scam???\\n\\nI just got this chrome book/laptop, and put it to charge. 3 hours later it is still dead. So frustrating. I had this for less than a year, too late to return, but not worth the $144 I spent for it - I took it in to have serviced, and the Geek Guy told me it is the mother board. Thought it may still be under warranty. I am going to try to get it serviced After 5 month the battery no longer taking the charge , barely used it . It’s frustrating when you trust and purchased an item and then it stop working . Whats even worst is its very costly to return items. Hoping. Someone can contact me . Don\\'t waste your $$$ after 2 weeks it no longer connects to wifi I must have gotten a bad one. The screen would have green squiggly lines when the background was white. Only been using it for 5 days and this morning it won’t turn on or even charge. Piece of junk. Definitely not worth it. It is not for someone who is computer illiterate like the person who I sent it. They can\\'t get past the set up. I barely used this because it was intended to be a back-up for travel. Kept it permanently plugged into wall socket and used once in awhile. Last week tried to boot up and it is completely blank screen - no power. Tested wall socket with other items it was fine. Tried plugging into other sockets, still dead. Now have to hassle with manufacturer warranty! I have no idea why this has 4.6 stars for gaming it can’t even run a simple iPhone game without crashing or absolutely frying the inside.\\n\\nAlthough it’s not for gaming. Basically the only thing this is useful for is browsing the internet and MAYBE streaming. It’s actual price is 50$ maybe even less. I ordered 2 of theses for my grandsons. They are very disappointed with the speed of the device and often describe it as being glitchy. I would like to return them since they don’t use them. How can I return this product? Opened this less than a month ago. The screen goes black and you have to turn it off and on until you can get it to work. Unfortunately ordered early for boyfriends birthday so can\\'t return. Don\\'t waste your money. Could not connect to Wi-Fi at Starbucks, 2 different McDonald’s, Kinko’s, or from 2 different Wi-Fi’s at an AT&T store. My phone had full Wi-Fi bars at each locale. Was finally able to connect at a laundromat. Wi-Fi sucks so I’m disappointed. I got this for my mom for her birthday and it turned on once. Now it won’t turn on again even though we have charged it up. I never make reviews or complain about anything but just know (because I did not look into the return policy) you CANNOT RETURN. My fault for not reading that but it still sucks I bought a computer that doesn’t work. I’d recommend not buying from them and buying from another company because yours may not work either. Its a good laptop as long as you don\\'t want to download anything, download the GOOGLE play store or even finish setting up the stupid thing because it can\\'t connect connect my wifi. Even though everything else does. Tried to trouble shoot. Don\\'t waste your money We did not have a password saved and were unable to get support from the company to help us set one up. Now we cannot get into the machine and it is useless. Do not purchase. This computer does not work at all it’s either frozen or shutting down. Called customer support and all they had me do was turn it on and off over and over. It came defective, screen said Chrome OS missing or damaged. Couldn’t get it to work. The screen is broken, will have to be replaced. Bought June 28 screen malfunction August 19, called company no support offered at all. Very disappointed they would not stand by their product. Cost to fix was more than I paid For it. It can only be used for very simple work. The screen resolution and brightness is bad. It become very slow while multiply programs run together. Obviously not new! Pretty disappointed right now. I love everything about this laptop besides the fact that everytime I use it, it keeps shutting off and turning back on at least a few times and I’m not sure why. My Chromebook lasted a whopping two years. It was difficult to scroll and impossible to update the apps. I am pretty sure they are designed to go kaput after two years. If anyone can recommend a good small lightweight laptop please let me know! After using the Chromebook for less than 2 years I got the dreaded \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged\" message. I tried to use the \"recovery disk\" as suggested on numerous sites but to no avail. Took it to Geek Squad where they worked on it for over a week before giving it up as a lost cause. The Chromebook is scrap. The operating system is unstable and cannot be relied on. Do yourself a favour and get a computer or or tablet with a real operating system. Unfortunately wasn\\'t what I needed but great small computer for small jobs. Still buying HP just bigger 😁 I bought this laptop for my sister and it took over 15 mins to start up. We have great Wi-Fi connection and I did not expect this from Awful performance from an HP laptop. Buyers Beware! I’m stuck with this junk of a laptop. Wish I could give 0 stars. Horrible customer service also. This will be a back up computer as we needed it in case one of the ones that we have now goes down. Everything not complete I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work. Dont listen to these other reviews. Love the colour. Great price.\\nCons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.\\nSpeaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won\\'t even allow me to add my school email. Working to help other in need.

Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. The \"Watchdog violation\" has been seen on Window\\'s stop code extraction. Did just a Windows update (Win11) procedure. The only third-party software installed to the moment is the Googe Drive. Yet don\\'t know the root of problem. The hard fault happened on Wi-Fi connection changing from established 5G to 2.5G within same router area. Although I like the compact size of the laptop, the absence of a calculator type numeric keypad is an inconvenience when dealing with several numbers. Bought this one for our son thats attending ASU for engineering. Added another 8G memory stick and this thing is a very capable workhorse. I need one for work travel and look forward to using it daily. Don\\'t hesitate on hitting the button. You will not be disappointed. I just wanted a laptop to pass the time but I was shocked by the quality of graphics and the benefit of such a light weight laptops mobility Have to reboot all the time as internet is slow when all the other devices in the house are fine When the computer isn\\'t plugged in, the laptop won\\'t turn on. If you fully charge it, then put it to sleep..When you open it the next day the battery will be dead and it won\\'t turn on. What good is a laptop if it always has to be plugged in? Useless. Trying to figure out how to contact HP about the one year warranty. It\\'s ridiculous how hard they make it.\\n\\nFlat out, I would not recommend this or buy this laptop again. Bought in May. In July, the unit boots up but the screen remains blank. Terrible support from Amazon and HP. Was initially told by an Amazon agent that I could have a replacement or refund no problem, but that agent ghosted us. Had to contact Amazon again and that agent put us in touch with HP. The HP agent put us through an hour and a half of ineffectual diagnostics before telling us we\\'d have to send it in for repair. So we won\\'t have use of this machine for another two weeks at least. And that\\'s assuming they can fix it! Please just give us our money back Amazon and HP! Quit wasting everyone\\'s time! this is the worse computer I\\'ve ever had...I the middle of setting up it froze and it been 5 hours and I can\\'t shut it down...and cant get up hpI\\'ve callHP and he was it still can;yt get it started...terrible product moderate to heavy typing is only doable if you type \"blind\" or you have a detached key that shows the letters clearly. This computer has me waiting 30 minutes just to search up something, the color is very trashy gray and dull, it is also false advertisement of 256 gbs of storage. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. I did not get a 8gb. It was 4gb, blue, and extremely slow. The entire laptop felt like a child\\'s toy. The screen was impossible to see. The quality overall was horrendous. I love HP, but was beyond disappointed with this product. Really poor quality right from the start. Computer is tricky to get to reliably turn on. Flimsy and breaks from falling less than 2 ft on a carpeted floor :-( HP will not honor any repair on accidental damage. My laptop was less than a month old when it happened. I sent it to them and HP quoted $619 to repair my $500 laptop. I will never buy HP again. I\\'m a Gmail guy I have a Gmail account I don\\'t want to change.....good luck getting past all the Microsoft monopoly malware to install chrome as a browser...super slow also Thought I bought the windows 11 version, but I guess not. And I didn’t realize this was the 2009 model…. Very disappointing. Bought/Set this up for a family member who just needed a very basic laptop. Laptop works fine but was disappointed that it doesn\\'t actually come with Windows 11 already loaded. It boots and gets you connected to the Internet and THEN it downloads and installs Windows 11. Everything I expected Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn\\'t going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn\\'t expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can\\'t find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn\\'t think I\\'d need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where\\'s the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn\\'t look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won\\'t run unless I\\'m connected to the internet. What? How\\'s that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I\\'m giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!! If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it\\'s pretty good I use this laptop for both work and personal things. So far, no issues. My only (small) complaint is that it runs a little loud. I want to say is this is not a touch screen, which is so disappointing i absolutely cannot get used the touch pad. I have tried to no avail. I didn\\'t realize it was touch pad or i would kept looking its terrible .missed my return window Although everything else is good ,just really not able to use it Dumps wifi driver and requires hard reset at least twice a week. I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.\\n\\nFast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We\\'ve been using Dell but I figured I\\'d save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She\\'s had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP\\'s quality issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately I can\\'t return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it\\'s time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.\\n\\nI\\'m giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand. Was not happy with the quality of screen, viewing was not crisp and clear. I thought I could live without a back-lit keyboard, but it is impossible to see the keys clearly because the characters, letters, numbers are very thin and almost the same color as the keys....especially if you don\\'t have 20/20 vision. I found this computer, for the money, only average compared to what I have owned before. Just love how fast it boots up fast which is what I was looking for.\\nHowever, this one\\'s connectivity is not good. First, I have had a few Wifi disconnects I don\\'t have on my previous HP or have with my phone on the same desk. I would never buy a computer w/o an ethernet outlet ever again. This one\\'s ports do not handle flash drive or camera media cards on its ports all so well. The media card is hard to remove and one got damaged: the little plastic slide to indicate write protected fell off. I have to tug hard to remove a USB. Also it doesn\\'t read some of my USB\\'s. I hope my old HP holds up. Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick. Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.\\n\\nIt feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.\\n\\nThe keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.\\n\\nOn the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.\\n\\n1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months\\n2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.\\n3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.\\n4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.\\n\\nThe quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.com\\n\\nThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing. The battery is simply horrible. I have to recharge every evening. Sending it back Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !! Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall. The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money! This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!! I\\'m a casual home user. This unit is awful. I don\\'t know the verbiage, but I\\'ve had nothing but problems since my purchase 2+ months ago. I still have my old HP PC which still works, it\\'s at least 10 yrs old. I\\'m done w HP. After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend. I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it\\'s NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me, & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #\\'s, etc with other places before buying here. Very disappointed, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t even get that. Very fast and powerful machine but onboard wifi failed after only two weeks of operation. Very disappointing. Getting mentally prepared for the warranty repair hassles. Update: decided buying a wifi dongle was a better option then wiping data, being without it for two weeks and having to set it up again. windows 11 = bad This laptop worked fine for about a month. It took me a while to transfer data, install Google accounts, and other software. One day, I sat down to use it and the internet was not available. When you click on the ball to see you internet options - that screen is gone. I took it to a trusted computer repair store, and he said the laptop is not acknowledging that there is a wireless card in it at all. This was actually a replacement laptop for the exact same one that I bought at Christmas that did the same thing. Now I am past the return window. Oh, and I\\'ve bought and installed a subscription to Microsoft 365 - money wasted probably. Bought in late Nov. Set up for wifi to download updates. Left it alone. Picked it up the other day to do some additional work and it doesn’t even recognize that it has a Wifi card. Do not buy any HP products, I have 5 HP Desktops and 2 printers. The hardware fails, & even with tech support they will transfer you to a “special department” which transfers you to another “special department” I had an issue with my pc not finding any printers in the office even though the other pcs can. Even though it was once connected. Obviously a hardware failure. Got bounced back to departments after they say oh it’s a desktop issue we’re transferring you to desktops, and then desktop transfers me to printers and back and and forth.. and back and forth.. I finally gave up. Will throw away pc. I only use this laptop for school work. I bought a laptop last year that failed me after only a year of working. Will update if this computer does the same I like the laptop it\\'s fast it boots quickly, but as you can see from the photo it\\'s almost impossible to read the keys which makes it almost unusable for me. Disgusting that this computer sold on prime day was sold as new and had another person as administrator from the UK with all his info . Had to hire someone to work to get him off😡😡😡 Windows 11, or whatever it has, really sucks and i hate it. Its bulky and slow. I am not a fan of windows 11. There seems to be a lot of clicking with very little action. This is a throw back. I just need a machine to fill in. I guess it will do that. I bought this item for last month when i back home and see thats a beautiful but it cannot work！！！！\\nThe backlight was broken!!!!! worst screen！！！\\nnobody want it！！！！！！！ The keyboard is very hard to see! I used to always buy Toshiba, this is my first HP laptop and won\\'t be the last. Only complaint is no backlight. I recieved this item yesterday and the touch pad did not work. Called HP tech support. He was able to get into my computer and do all the updates as well as unlock the device after 2 hours the tech tells me it is a hrad ware issue and teh device touch pad is defected and to return the device. I printed off the return label only to find out that I have to pay to have this defective device in order to return. There is no contact info for the seller to discuss this issue further. Very unhappy customer Had problems from the very start! Pop up says this laptop has bad image on the c/drive. Not very reassuring for a brand new laptop! I think someone did a modification incorrectly! Buyer beware! Had Lenovo products previously and never had any problems! Laptop is fine. Just need it for work, so doesn\\'t need to be super crazy. However, it arrived with no charging cable or any way to charge it. So, not thrilled about having to fork out another $60 for one :/ You have to plug in charges after to hours of usage. Waste of money I was very disappointed to find that this unit had a flaw in the screen that prevented the left 1/4 of the screen from displaying anything. It looked like a very nice computer except for the flaw in the screen I sent it back for a refund. The battery would not charge from the start. Turns out the battery was no good. Horrible. This a a perfectly adequate laptop but it does not have a touchscreen. My bad - one just assumes in this day and age but no. It was a hard adjustment from my last laptop. The keyboard works well and the screen is sharp but I still can\\'t help but try and move things with my fingers.....\\nREAD. Be sure you read before you buy. Screen size war to small for my eye problem. Need a desktop with a large monitor. So sad. Its not touch screen even though it says, heavy lag, hard to use finger pad. I hate it I have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, according to the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differs in that the 9FY38UA has Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 4 core processor and I have received HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA ) with 2-core Intel® Celeron® N4000 processor. Half the performance!!!\\nThe Celeron N5000 processor described in the Ad Title does not exist, only the Intel Pentium N5000 exists. Unfortunately, these types of errors in the product announcement are not taken into account by Amazon, they are not corrected and the international return costs are not assumed, in my case, from Colombia. This being the case, I lose money when making the return, since international shipping costs are very high and it ends up not making the return because of losing more money.\\nThis purchase did not go well for me. A processor with half the performance I would expect if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device!!\\n\\nI have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, based on the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differs in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received HP Chromebook -14a- na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor.

A processor with half the performance of the expected if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device !! I was disappointed that it wasn\\'t a Windows machine. I am still learning how to navigate the Chrome OS. I like the speed. This leaves my Dell Inspiron with 8 gig RAM and an i5 in the dust with half the RAM.\\nIts6a great value for the money. So usually I\\'m a pretty lazy person when it comes to returning items, like it has to be flat out awful or just not worth the hassle of keeping for me to actually return something. That being said it\\'s looking like this will have to be returned. It would have been great if not for the mouse messing up almost every second. I love the light weight and the smooth keys but this dang mouse is too annoying to keep. Guess I\\'ll spend a lil extra and get a computer that isnt used. Too bad The Chromebook itself is okay but the seller did not reset the item to factory settings and I received it with an existing account and everything was in Spanish. It took me a while to have it reset and Amazon support couldn’t help because I was told it’s a third party vendor. I was very disappointed with the entire situation. I bought this CB solely for the fact that it was advertised as keyboard being backlit. It\\'s not and I\\'m extremely disappointed. Aside from this fact, the unit performs well Photos are not true to the product. I have had two individuals now tell me it is HFMI and the photos show it is. It does notbin fact have an HDMi port. I anticipated this but the fact I\\'m being lied to about it warrants this review. Stop lying. I received my laptop after rush shipment only to be disappointed because it doesn’t work! I started it up and it was stuck on the start up wifi connection screen. So I contacted technical support and they couldn’t help me didn’t even try to help me troubleshoot it. All they did was start a return for me, which I can do myself!\\n\\nI’m so disappointed because I needed this for school and now I’m out of my money due to pending refund. Now I’m having to run to Best Buy and spend more money! I dislike that the computer arrived with a password from the previous owner. The process to get the guest password was ridiculous and quite annoying and frustrating! I will buy new from now on. Keep cutting off on full charge\\nIt first started cutting off on a full battery.. won’t turn on without it first being on the charger.. it froze so I tried restarting it but then it said chrome os is missing or damaged All I have to say is this IS NOT BRAND NEW!!. Its refurbished, and if you need a new computer do not buy this. Its luck and chance it may work perfectly or not at all.🤷\\u200d♀️ BEWARE!!! USELESS!!! ITS A GLORIFIED PHONE. (W/O the calls)Bought this refurbished computer to learn the basics.. COULD NOT DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 10.. this computer SHOULD not be sold by amazon.. and I will be talking to them about taking it off the market.. if you can\\'t run windows.. than you don\\'t have a computer ... shame on either Amazon for allowing this seller to sell this.. Amazon handled it great.. as far as refund etc.. but it should not be sold.. idk what can be run on this I bought this new laptop for my son. He was very frustrated when he could not use this computer for Microsoft, Apple or Steam gaming sites. Only had this Chromebook 10 months and it already took a dump. Don\\'t waste your money. The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It\\'s very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing. It stop working after a few days and had to be returned. It only had one usb port, from camera was total garbage and it overall failed to live up to its potential. Very bad, it did not help me to make my drawings with kamvas 13 I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it. The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy. Don\\'t ever buy a Chromebook it\\'s a waste of money!!!! Can\\'t use it is very poor quality Dumb asf, AMAZON KEEP FUCKIN UP MY MONEY'"

       "'It was running smooth for the first month or so I had it, and then randomly after booting up a certain steam game it would always randomly turn off the screen and leave the actual computer on. I couldn\\'t turn the screen back on I had to restart the whole laptop. It would happen about 3 times per actual game playing session. And then I noticed it was way slower when booting up after not being used for a while. It would sit on desktop and take 3 minutes to open either Spotify, steam, google, or anything. And today it gave me the blue screen of death. I never downloaded anything fishy, just steam games Spotify and then I browsed YouTube every now and then. I remember buying a laptop from bestbuy like 3 years ago for 400$ cad and it was almost as fast as this laptop which is 1400& cad. I mean the laptop worked again after I restarted it a few times, which is good. It still sorta works. But who knows how much worse it will get over time. Might just return it instead of getting a tech guy to fix it if I can. little expensive Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. It works , not too slow I liked this computer allot up until it just stopped working after 14 months. I purchased this computer for 2 purposes. First to work from home remotely during the pandemic and second to run CAD Software for my desktop CNC router. I did not use it for anything else and was extremely careful on what it was used for as well as kept it in emaculent condition. I also saved anything other than the necessary software on an external hard drive. After the 1 year manufacturers warranty expired the laptop would just freeze shortly after turning on and an error screen would show up. It forced me to restart the computer and the same thing would happen. I took it to two different IT experts both said there is something severely wrong with the hardware. They both tried everything they knew to fix the problem unsuccessfully. The computer is useless at this point. About 6 months after owning the computer very rarely the computer would freeze and would need to be restarted. This was so rare it wasn\\'t really an issue and would always work after being restarted until one day after owning for 14 months or just locked up and wouldn\\'t work. I factory reset it which was almost impossible given how it wouldn\\'t work but was able to. My IT coworker tried reinstalling the driver software from Nvidia and he did a bunch of things I am not knowledgeable on to discuss. Moral of the story buy another brand as I am because I no longer trust the quality of HP. Which is sad because I try to support American companies and try to buy American made or American owned when the prior is not an option. I was a Mac/apple guy but most CAD SOFTWARE requires windows so I bought this HP as my first PC in over 15 years. I am considering going back to Apple as some CAD companies have software that can be run using a Mac. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! Working to help other in need. I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow.

Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Affordable for working remotely Within a week of receiving this product, the touchpad would randomly stop working. After a while, it would start working again. This seemed to happen randomly with it working for hours then not working for hours. Since it was within the 30 days, I returned it for a full refund.\\n\\nHowever, the company stated that this touchpad is working find and only gave me a partial refund because of the restocking fee. After asking them if they looked only briefly or for a while, like my reason stated, they refused to even provide an answer. They only pointed towards Amazon customer service to ask for a full refund for me. Luckily, Amazon customer service covered the difference without any hassle.\\n\\nDon\\'t support SkyNetWorks. My excitement for getting a Chromebook to still study and write when I\\'m too sick/tired to sit up was dampened considerably when this got here.\\n\\nBasically, something is wrong with the screen. Not just in this one - the issue is still present even in the replacement that Amazon sent. It seems to have a problem with skin in particular, along with pale colors, and using the built-in \"night light\" feature or Screen Shader extension on Chrome to reduce blue light makes it worse. When watching videos, people will commonly have huge blotches of green pixels along their skin. And in normal windows, green lines and splotches will often appear for no reason at all.\\n\\nInitially I tried talking to HP Support about the issue, and they actually tried to foist me off on a \"specialist\" that I would have to pay for - to get help on a brand new Chromebook that I hadn\\'t even had for an hour yet! Thankfully Amazon support was more reasonable, and they simply offered to set up a return and send me a replacement in the meantime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue is persisting even in the replacement. I can only assume it\\'s a common defect in this model now, maybe in some awful push to try and get people to buy the newer and more expensive one. Don\\'t waste your money or time - get a different Chromebook, from a different brand! UPDATE: so I returned the first one. Which I paid only $90 for it. Reordered another one; then got charged $119 plus tax for it, it still has not been shipped. Just looked at them again and now they’re asking $129 plus tax. Is this a scam???\\n\\nI just got this chrome book/laptop, and put it to charge. 3 hours later it is still dead. So frustrating. I had this for less than a year, too late to return, but not worth the $144 I spent for it - I took it in to have serviced, and the Geek Guy told me it is the mother board. Thought it may still be under warranty. I am going to try to get it serviced After 5 month the battery no longer taking the charge , barely used it . It’s frustrating when you trust and purchased an item and then it stop working . Whats even worst is its very costly to return items. Hoping. Someone can contact me . Don\\'t waste your $$$ after 2 weeks it no longer connects to wifi I must have gotten a bad one. The screen would have green squiggly lines when the background was white. Only been using it for 5 days and this morning it won’t turn on or even charge. Piece of junk. Definitely not worth it. It is not for someone who is computer illiterate like the person who I sent it. They can\\'t get past the set up. I barely used this because it was intended to be a back-up for travel. Kept it permanently plugged into wall socket and used once in awhile. Last week tried to boot up and it is completely blank screen - no power. Tested wall socket with other items it was fine. Tried plugging into other sockets, still dead. Now have to hassle with manufacturer warranty! I have no idea why this has 4.6 stars for gaming it can’t even run a simple iPhone game without crashing or absolutely frying the inside.\\n\\nAlthough it’s not for gaming. Basically the only thing this is useful for is browsing the internet and MAYBE streaming. It’s actual price is 50$ maybe even less. I ordered 2 of theses for my grandsons. They are very disappointed with the speed of the device and often describe it as being glitchy. I would like to return them since they don’t use them. How can I return this product? Opened this less than a month ago. The screen goes black and you have to turn it off and on until you can get it to work. Unfortunately ordered early for boyfriends birthday so can\\'t return. Don\\'t waste your money. Could not connect to Wi-Fi at Starbucks, 2 different McDonald’s, Kinko’s, or from 2 different Wi-Fi’s at an AT&T store. My phone had full Wi-Fi bars at each locale. Was finally able to connect at a laundromat. Wi-Fi sucks so I’m disappointed. I got this for my mom for her birthday and it turned on once. Now it won’t turn on again even though we have charged it up. I never make reviews or complain about anything but just know (because I did not look into the return policy) you CANNOT RETURN. My fault for not reading that but it still sucks I bought a computer that doesn’t work. I’d recommend not buying from them and buying from another company because yours may not work either. Its a good laptop as long as you don\\'t want to download anything, download the GOOGLE play store or even finish setting up the stupid thing because it can\\'t connect connect my wifi. Even though everything else does. Tried to trouble shoot. Don\\'t waste your money We did not have a password saved and were unable to get support from the company to help us set one up. Now we cannot get into the machine and it is useless. Do not purchase. This computer does not work at all it’s either frozen or shutting down. Called customer support and all they had me do was turn it on and off over and over. It came defective, screen said Chrome OS missing or damaged. Couldn’t get it to work. The screen is broken, will have to be replaced. Bought June 28 screen malfunction August 19, called company no support offered at all. Very disappointed they would not stand by their product. Cost to fix was more than I paid For it. It can only be used for very simple work. The screen resolution and brightness is bad. It become very slow while multiply programs run together. Obviously not new! Pretty disappointed right now. I love everything about this laptop besides the fact that everytime I use it, it keeps shutting off and turning back on at least a few times and I’m not sure why. My Chromebook lasted a whopping two years. It was difficult to scroll and impossible to update the apps. I am pretty sure they are designed to go kaput after two years. If anyone can recommend a good small lightweight laptop please let me know! After using the Chromebook for less than 2 years I got the dreaded \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged\" message. I tried to use the \"recovery disk\" as suggested on numerous sites but to no avail. Took it to Geek Squad where they worked on it for over a week before giving it up as a lost cause. The Chromebook is scrap. The operating system is unstable and cannot be relied on. Do yourself a favour and get a computer or or tablet with a real operating system. Unfortunately wasn\\'t what I needed but great small computer for small jobs. Still buying HP just bigger 😁 I bought this laptop for my sister and it took over 15 mins to start up. We have great Wi-Fi connection and I did not expect this from Awful performance from an HP laptop. Buyers Beware! I’m stuck with this junk of a laptop. Wish I could give 0 stars. Horrible customer service also. This will be a back up computer as we needed it in case one of the ones that we have now goes down. Everything not complete I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work. Dont listen to these other reviews. Love the colour. Great price.\\nCons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.\\nSpeaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won\\'t even allow me to add my school email. Working to help other in need. I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. The \"Watchdog violation\" has been seen on Window\\'s stop code extraction. Did just a Windows update (Win11) procedure. The only third-party software installed to the moment is the Googe Drive. Yet don\\'t know the root of problem. The hard fault happened on Wi-Fi connection changing from established 5G to 2.5G within same router area. Although I like the compact size of the laptop, the absence of a calculator type numeric keypad is an inconvenience when dealing with several numbers. Bought this one for our son thats attending ASU for engineering. Added another 8G memory stick and this thing is a very capable workhorse. I need one for work travel and look forward to using it daily. Don\\'t hesitate on hitting the button. You will not be disappointed. I just wanted a laptop to pass the time but I was shocked by the quality of graphics and the benefit of such a light weight laptops mobility Have to reboot all the time as internet is slow when all the other devices in the house are fine When the computer isn\\'t plugged in, the laptop won\\'t turn on. If you fully charge it, then put it to sleep..When you open it the next day the battery will be dead and it won\\'t turn on. What good is a laptop if it always has to be plugged in? Useless. Trying to figure out how to contact HP about the one year warranty. It\\'s ridiculous how hard they make it.\\n\\nFlat out, I would not recommend this or buy this laptop again. Bought in May. In July, the unit boots up but the screen remains blank. Terrible support from Amazon and HP. Was initially told by an Amazon agent that I could have a replacement or refund no problem, but that agent ghosted us. Had to contact Amazon again and that agent put us in touch with HP. The HP agent put us through an hour and a half of ineffectual diagnostics before telling us we\\'d have to send it in for repair. So we won\\'t have use of this machine for another two weeks at least. And that\\'s assuming they can fix it! Please just give us our money back Amazon and HP! Quit wasting everyone\\'s time! this is the worse computer I\\'ve ever had...I the middle of setting up it froze and it been 5 hours and I can\\'t shut it down...and cant get up hpI\\'ve callHP and he was it still can;yt get it started...terrible product moderate to heavy typing is only doable if you type \"blind\" or you have a detached key that shows the letters clearly. This computer has me waiting 30 minutes just to search up something, the color is very trashy gray and dull, it is also false advertisement of 256 gbs of storage. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. I did not get a 8gb. It was 4gb, blue, and extremely slow. The entire laptop felt like a child\\'s toy. The screen was impossible to see. The quality overall was horrendous. I love HP, but was beyond disappointed with this product. Really poor quality right from the start. Computer is tricky to get to reliably turn on. Flimsy and breaks from falling less than 2 ft on a carpeted floor :-( HP will not honor any repair on accidental damage. My laptop was less than a month old when it happened. I sent it to them and HP quoted $619 to repair my $500 laptop. I will never buy HP again. I\\'m a Gmail guy I have a Gmail account I don\\'t want to change.....good luck getting past all the Microsoft monopoly malware to install chrome as a browser...super slow also Thought I bought the windows 11 version, but I guess not. And I didn’t realize this was the 2009 model…. Very disappointing. Bought/Set this up for a family member who just needed a very basic laptop. Laptop works fine but was disappointed that it doesn\\'t actually come with Windows 11 already loaded. It boots and gets you connected to the Internet and THEN it downloads and installs Windows 11. Everything I expected Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn\\'t going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn\\'t expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can\\'t find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn\\'t think I\\'d need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where\\'s the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn\\'t look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won\\'t run unless I\\'m connected to the internet. What? How\\'s that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I\\'m giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!! If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it\\'s pretty good I use this laptop for both work and personal things. So far, no issues. My only (small) complaint is that it runs a little loud. I want to say is this is not a touch screen, which is so disappointing i absolutely cannot get used the touch pad. I have tried to no avail. I didn\\'t realize it was touch pad or i would kept looking its terrible .missed my return window Although everything else is good ,just really not able to use it Dumps wifi driver and requires hard reset at least twice a week. I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.\\n\\nFast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We\\'ve been using Dell but I figured I\\'d save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She\\'s had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP\\'s quality issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately I can\\'t return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it\\'s time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.\\n\\nI\\'m giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand. Was not happy with the quality of screen, viewing was not crisp and clear. I thought I could live without a back-lit keyboard, but it is impossible to see the keys clearly because the characters, letters, numbers are very thin and almost the same color as the keys....especially if you don\\'t have 20/20 vision. I found this computer, for the money, only average compared to what I have owned before. Just love how fast it boots up fast which is what I was looking for.\\nHowever, this one\\'s connectivity is not good. First, I have had a few Wifi disconnects I don\\'t have on my previous HP or have with my phone on the same desk. I would never buy a computer w/o an ethernet outlet ever again. This one\\'s ports do not handle flash drive or camera media cards on its ports all so well. The media card is hard to remove and one got damaged: the little plastic slide to indicate write protected fell off. I have to tug hard to remove a USB. Also it doesn\\'t read some of my USB\\'s. I hope my old HP holds up. Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick. Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.\\n\\nIt feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.\\n\\nThe keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.\\n\\nOn the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.\\n\\n1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months\\n2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.\\n3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.\\n4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.\\n\\nThe quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.com\\n\\nThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing. The battery is simply horrible. I have to recharge every evening. Sending it back Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !! Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall. The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money! This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!! I\\'m a casual home user. This unit is awful. I don\\'t know the verbiage, but I\\'ve had nothing but problems since my purchase 2 months ago. I still have my old HP PC which still works, it\\'s at least 10 yrs old. I\\'m done w HP. After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend. I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it\\'s NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me, & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #\\'s, etc with other places before buying here. Very disappointed, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t even get that. Very fast and powerful machine but onboard wifi failed after only two weeks of operation. Very disappointing. Getting mentally prepared for the warranty repair hassles. Update: decided buying a wifi dongle was a better option then wiping data, being without it for two weeks and having to set it up again. windows 11 = bad This laptop worked fine for about a month. It took me a while to transfer data, install Google accounts, and other software. One day, I sat down to use it and the internet was not available. When you click on the ball to see you internet options - that screen is gone. I took it to a trusted computer repair store, and he said the laptop is not acknowledging that there is a wireless card in it at all. This was actually a replacement laptop for the exact same one that I bought at Christmas that did the same thing. Now I am past the return window. Oh, and I\\'ve bought and installed a subscription to Microsoft 365 - money wasted probably. Bought in late Nov. Set up for wifi to download updates. Left it alone. Picked it up the other day to do some additional work and it doesn’t even recognize that it has a Wifi card. Do not buy any HP products, I have 5 HP Desktops and 2 printers. The hardware fails, & even with tech support they will transfer you to a “special department” which transfers you to another “special department” I had an issue with my pc not finding any printers in the office even though the other pcs can. Even though it was once connected. Obviously a hardware failure. Got bounced back to departments after they say oh it’s a desktop issue we’re transferring you to desktops, and then desktop transfers me to printers and back and and forth.. and back and forth.. I finally gave up. Will throw away pc. I only use this laptop for school work. I bought a laptop last year that failed me after only a year of working. Will update if this computer does the same I like the laptop it\\'s fast it boots quickly, but as you can see from the photo it\\'s almost impossible to read the keys which makes it almost unusable for me. Disgusting that this computer sold on prime day was sold as new and had another person as administrator from the UK with all his info . Had to hire someone to work to get him off😡😡😡 Windows 11, or whatever it has, really sucks and i hate it. Its bulky and slow. I am not a fan of windows 11. There seems to be a lot of clicking with very little action. This is a throw back. I just need a machine to fill in. I guess it will do that. I bought this item for last month when i back home and see thats a beautiful but it cannot work！！！！\\nThe backlight was broken!!!!! worst screen！！！\\nnobody want it！！！！！！！ The keyboard is very hard to see! I used to always buy Toshiba, this is my first HP laptop and won\\'t be the last. Only complaint is no backlight. I recieved this item yesterday and the touch pad did not work. Called HP tech support. He was able to get into my computer and do all the updates as well as unlock the device after 2 hours the tech tells me it is a hrad ware issue and teh device touch pad is defected and to return the device. I printed off the return label only to find out that I have to pay to have this defective device in order to return. There is no contact info for the seller to discuss this issue further. Very unhappy customer Had problems from the very start! Pop up says this laptop has bad image on the c/drive. Not very reassuring for a brand new laptop! I think someone did a modification incorrectly! Buyer beware! Had Lenovo products previously and never had any problems! Laptop is fine. Just need it for work, so doesn\\'t need to be super crazy. However, it arrived with no charging cable or any way to charge it. So, not thrilled about having to fork out another $60 for one :/ You have to plug in charges after to hours of usage. Waste of money I was very disappointed to find that this unit had a flaw in the screen that prevented the left 1/4 of the screen from displaying anything. It looked like a very nice computer except for the flaw in the screen I sent it back for a refund. The battery would not charge from the start. Turns out the battery was no good. Horrible. This a a perfectly adequate laptop but it does not have a touchscreen. My bad - one just assumes in this day and age but no. It was a hard adjustment from my last laptop. The keyboard works well and the screen is sharp but I still can\\'t help but try and move things with my fingers.....\\nREAD. Be sure you read before you buy. Screen size war to small for my eye problem. Need a desktop with a large monitor. So sad. Its not touch screen even though it says, heavy lag, hard to use finger pad. I hate it I have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, according to the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differs in that the 9FY38UA has Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 4 core processor and I have received HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA ) with 2-core Intel® Celeron® N4000 processor. Half the performance!!!\\nThe Celeron N5000 processor described in the Ad Title does not exist, only the Intel Pentium N5000 exists. Unfortunately, these types of errors in the product announcement are not taken into account by Amazon, they are not corrected and the international return costs are not assumed, in my case, from Colombia. This being the case, I lose money when making the return, since international shipping costs are very high and it ends up not making the return because of losing more money.\\nThis purchase did not go well for me. A processor with half the performance I would expect if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device!!\\n\\nI have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, based on the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differs in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received HP Chromebook -14a- na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor.

A processor with half the performance of the expected if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device !! I was disappointed that it wasn\\'t a Windows machine. I am still learning how to navigate the Chrome OS. I like the speed. This leaves my Dell Inspiron with 8 gig RAM and an i5 in the dust with half the RAM.\\nIts6a great value for the money. So usually I\\'m a pretty lazy person when it comes to returning items, like it has to be flat out awful or just not worth the hassle of keeping for me to actually return something. That being said it\\'s looking like this will have to be returned. It would have been great if not for the mouse messing up almost every second. I love the light weight and the smooth keys but this dang mouse is too annoying to keep. Guess I\\'ll spend a lil extra and get a computer that isnt used. Too bad The Chromebook itself is okay but the seller did not reset the item to factory settings and I received it with an existing account and everything was in Spanish. It took me a while to have it reset and Amazon support couldn’t help because I was told it’s a third party vendor. I was very disappointed with the entire situation. I bought this CB solely for the fact that it was advertised as keyboard being backlit. It\\'s not and I\\'m extremely disappointed. Aside from this fact, the unit performs well Photos are not true to the product. I have had two individuals now tell me it is HFMI and the photos show it is. It does notbin fact have an HDMi port. I anticipated this but the fact I\\'m being lied to about it warrants this review. Stop lying. I received my laptop after rush shipment only to be disappointed because it doesn’t work! I started it up and it was stuck on the start up wifi connection screen. So I contacted technical support and they couldn’t help me didn’t even try to help me troubleshoot it. All they did was start a return for me, which I can do myself!\\n\\nI’m so disappointed because I needed this for school and now I’m out of my money due to pending refund. Now I’m having to run to Best Buy and spend more money! I dislike that the computer arrived with a password from the previous owner. The process to get the guest password was ridiculous and quite annoying and frustrating! I will buy new from now on. Keep cutting off on full charge\\nIt first started cutting off on a full battery.. won’t turn on without it first being on the charger.. it froze so I tried restarting it but then it said chrome os is missing or damaged All I have to say is this IS NOT BRAND NEW!!. Its refurbished, and if you need a new computer do not buy this. Its luck and chance it may work perfectly or not at all.🤷\\u200d♀️ BEWARE!!! USELESS!!! ITS A GLORIFIED PHONE. (W/O the calls)Bought this refurbished computer to learn the basics.. COULD NOT DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 10.. this computer SHOULD not be sold by amazon.. and I will be talking to them about taking it off the market.. if you can\\'t run windows.. than you don\\'t have a computer ... shame on either Amazon for allowing this seller to sell this.. Amazon handled it great.. as far as refund etc.. but it should not be sold.. idk what can be run on this I bought this new laptop for my son. He was very frustrated when he could not use this computer for Microsoft, Apple or Steam gaming sites. Only had this Chromebook 10 months and it already took a dump. Don\\'t waste your money. The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It\\'s very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing. It stop working after a few days and had to be returned. It only had one usb port, from camera was total garbage and it overall failed to live up to its potential. Very bad, it did not help me to make my drawings with kamvas 13 I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it. The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy. Don\\'t ever buy a Chromebook it\\'s a waste of money!!!! Can\\'t use it is very poor quality Dumb asf, AMAZON KEEP FUCKIN UP MY MONEY'"
