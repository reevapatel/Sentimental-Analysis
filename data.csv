0,jackhandy,"i do audio work for video games: creating sfx in a daw(digital audio workstation) and or composing midi mockup scores using kontakt and a ton of heavy ram use orchestral sample library. the 32g ram on this and the 1tb ssd is a HUGE boon for audio work! i use both ableton and reaper daw. they load super snappy. my kontakt heavy projects load ultra fast now (versus the pc tower i was using, which was still quite powerful).

the laptop runs fairly quiet even at heavier cpu loads. i composed a piece of music for a game of thrones video game which ran about 60-70% cpu on my other, fastest computer(the pc tower). this hp laptop, it clocks in at a cool 50%. so ive been able to have tons of cpu intense plugins (such as ozone8 or reaktor) running in the daw projects no problem. i was able to turn the cpu down to 0% in the windows power management panel and set the cooling to passive- which causes the laptop to run slower, but basically run silent because less heat generation. which is perfect when i need to record foley or my own voice for use with creatures in the games. i can then turn the cpu back up to full speed when composing or integrating the sound and music into the games.

the graphics card on this isnt 100% the best but im still able to run unity and hook up sounds into 3d games that way without any lag via a 2k screen. really this isnt a gaming pc (only due to the level/integration of its graphics card) like you might not be able to easily run the latest greatest fps at full settings and stream on twitch at the same time without some drop in frame rate(but who knows maybe u can? i didnt test this fully), but im confident you could still run just about any game regardless (w tweaked setting most likely).

just as a test i loaded up one of my all time fav games: skyrim, and one of the heftier mods and it seemed to run amazingly well in 2k (with all the game's graphics settings turned up). i havent tried video capturing a game like that but with the right settings in obs i think it could work fine (probably no more than 60fps id imagine).

i do do a lot of video capturing for my job: getting animations and vfx clips to bring into the daw to make sound effects with and so far this laptop does not even blink w those basic vid cap tasks.

i also do photography and video editing on the side for my own projects. photoshop runs like a total breeze on this! ive never had a smoother photoshop experience, personally. after effects is fast to edit/splice preview etc but some of the render times (especially when using twixtor) still take time. a 20 minute time stretched(200% vector blend) 2k video with color correction and film grain layers added took about 2+hr to render. so obvs not the best laptop out there for major video effects work but i think still totally doable and capable for those working more in the premiere type video editing layout arena.

my only complaint is that the laptop feels cheapo plastic (this is my first non mac in a while so theres that) so for work-traveling(which is why i ultimately got this) i think ill need to get a good solid case and just treat this like a newborn baby during its life span.

with the crazy power of this thing, given the requirements of my audio/photoshop work, i think this will be a super solid computer for me for the next 10years at least. and for $800 what a crazy steal!","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States ,"September 24, 2022",5.0
1,Trayson Lancaster,"I've had this laptop for a week now, which has been enough time for me to gauge my issues with it:

- - Speaker volume auto-adjusts (video footage provided) - -

(Okay so I figured this first one out, so skip this paragraph, unless you have the same issue, cuz I'll mention my solution at the end of it.)

~~I've troubleshooted this through every process suggested online, and can't seem to find a solution or explanation. Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it'll cut to a lower volume and then stay there. And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again, it'll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume. This happens exclusively with the speaker, as in the headphones work just fine. I've turned off enhancements, changed every setting in the control panel sound settings, options sound settings, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled B&O. Nothing fixes the issue, and it's very noticeable. I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers (the volume fluctuating is that noticeable).~~

... Okay, so I figured that out. I needed to go to ""device manager"" and instead of trying to update the audio driver by searching automatically for one, I had to instead search for one that came already downloaded on the computer. In this case, what fixed my problem, was setting the audio driver to the HD one, and then going back to the control panel speaker settings, and going to the enhancements tab (that wasn't present before to turn off all enhancements. This 100% fixed the stupid auto volume adjusting crap. (The default audio driver just sucks, not having much needed options.)

- - Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it's hard to see regardless, with heavy resistance - -

Now I wouldn't mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing. But in this case, the keyboard does not have lit keys, has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it's hard to make out what they keys are, and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press. Think of like a membrane keyboard, but just a little more resistant than that. Very clicky/noisy too. It doesn't feel great, but I could probably get used to it all.

- - 6-bit color bit depth? - -

I do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use (phone and computer monitor). Then when I found that the display was set as a 6-bit color bit depth, I realized that this might be the reason why. After searching all around online to see if this was changeable, I've concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself. Not the best, and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed.

And then here are some non-issues that I've faced (as in things I've been frustrated with, but it's not that big of a deal).

- It comes preloaded with Windows 11 (I just downloaded 10 and did a fresh reboot with that)
- Battery life isn't the greatest, but I wasn't expecting much in that department
- So much bloatware, but I guess that's more the fault of Microsoft than HP, since Windows 10 includes all kinds of useless crap (that I spent roughly 6 hours removing)

Everything else has been great. If I can just get used to the keyboard (the placement of every key, and the ""weight"" of them), then this seems like a purchase generally worth $880. I'll just have to accept less than ideal color depth (it's not that bad tbf). I wouldn't mind spending a couple hundred more to fix these issues, and maybe have separate action keys that aren't the same as the function keys (since I use those quite often). I might consider that, but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school and just other things outside my room, which I know this will suffice for a good while.","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States ,"November 4, 2022",4.0

3,Puck,"This is by far the fastest laptop I have ever owned. It starts up very quickly and shuts down quickly. When you open an excel file, the file opens before the click of the mouse fades away.
8 core processer
32 GB of memory
1 TB solid state drive
Extended display with little display border
Nice display
Very thin and light
The people who put in the upgrades must have used soft gloves because the computer did not have a scratch on it and started up as a brand new computer.

All for $910 including tax is an incredible value.

I do agree with one reviewer that the letters on the key could be more white if color to see them easier, but that is such a minor issue to all of the plusses.

If your current laptop has become sloe for you, this is a great replacement at a more than reasonable price.","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States ,"September 24, 2022",5.0

6,John A. Chemycz,"The Ryzen chip is very fast and there is no lag with the video response with the onboard Radeon graphics. I'm thrilled with the 32 GB of RAM and the 1 TB SSD It's an incredible little powerhouse and clearly with the $899 price tag. My only problem with the computer is the poor design of the keyboard !!! Okay, I knew going in that the keyboard wasn't BACKLIT, but I never thought they would be STUPID enough to have BLACK keys with CHARCOAL LETTERING !!! It makes it nearly impossible to use in low-light environments. I had to resort to propping a small flashlight against my head and shoulder to illuminate the keyboard adequately to see what I was typing. I( later ordered a USB LED light to provide the light source, but really ... WHY NOT A BRIGHT WHITE LETTERING ON THE BLACK KEYES ???

7,Dmitry Garanin,"I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop's body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.

On the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don't need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.

I haven't found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don't see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination.","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States ,"February 9, 2022",4.0

9,Karen S. Cole,"I like this HP Pavilion. I've owned several HP computers and printers before, I'm currently using an HP printer and this computer is the one I'm now reviewing. It works great, I'm able to type this review with no worries, there have only been a few minor glitches, all fixable by me. So far at least. HP has a lot of great support services in general, and this hard drive is just under one terabyte, they never seem to make it up to the full hard drive status they advertise. And I'm worried about defragmenting the drive, it's a solid state drive and you can't really defragment a drive of that type without harming the machine. Or the hard drive. So I'm hoping it will be okay, and I can manage without using defragmentation services.","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States ,"June 18, 2022",5.0
10,AndyG,"I've had this computer for a couple of weeks now. I paid about $1000 including tax (CA). Not a lot of computer makers offer a Ryzen 7-5700U, yet. With 32MB of RAM and 1TB SSD it's almost a steal.
It doesn't offer frills like folding back the display, touch screen, or lighted keys. But what I would have liked is Windows 11 Professional instead of Home and School.
I made it dual boot, and installed openSUSE Leap 15.3 next to Windows. The dual boot works fine. However, I haven't been successful yet getting the Ryzen to work at full resolution. That's not HP's fault, but rather AMD which doesn't provide its Radeon drivers as public domain.
Overall, so far I'm happy with this computer. I hope it will last a long time.","2022 Newest HP Pavilion 15.6"" FHD 1080P IPS Laptop, 8-Core AMD Ryzen 7-5700U",United States,"June 20, 2022",5.0

19,Kim B.,"I purchased this in March. Right away, the unit was going to sleep an I could only wake it by using the power button to turn it off and on; a 5-star HP tech fixed that. A couple of weks ago it started freezing and turning off. After several hours on a bad phone connection, they decided to send me a USB recovery drive, which wiped Windows and all the applications. After doing that and reloading the apps, it started again. This time it was shutting down because of Windows errors. Finally, Microsoft told me that it was no-doubt a hardware issue, but showed me how to reload Windows 11 in a way that would keep my files and apps in place. Told me that should fix it, unless it is a hardware issue. Didn't work. I leave for an hour, come back, and it's re-booted. I'm a small business man that relies 100% on my computer. HP's solution is to send me a postage-paid box for me to pack the computer and send back to them so they can repair it. Meantime, I'm left without a way to communicate with and service my customers. I used to use HP inkjet printers. They were good for about a year before dying. I'm through with HP. Bought myself a nice Lenovo for a great price at Costco today.

23,Joshua Faryon,"It was running smooth for the first month or so I had it, and then randomly after booting up a certain steam game it would always randomly turn off the screen and leave the actual computer on. I couldn't turn the screen back on I had to restart the whole laptop. It would happen about 3 times per actual game playing session. And then I noticed it was way slower when booting up after not being used for a while. It would sit on desktop and take 3 minutes to open either Spotify, steam, google, or anything. And today it gave me the blue screen of death. I never downloaded anything fishy, just steam games Spotify and then I browsed YouTube every now and then. I remember buying a laptop from bestbuy like 3 years ago for 400$ cad and it was almost as fast as this laptop which is 1400& cad. I mean the laptop worked again after I restarted it a few times, which is good. It still sorta works. But who knows how much worse it will get over time.

40,Catherine,"I'm a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop ""work"" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.

About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the ""Windows 10-S."" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to ""Windows 11 Home,"" which is more capable of evading corporate MS's iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a matter of going into ""settings"" and changing it.

I do not mind the PC and MS ""marriage"" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).

As far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.
My overall opinion is ""nice."" It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment.

Cons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.
Speaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won't even allow me to add my school email.","Newest HP 14"" HD Laptop, Windows 11, Intel Celeron Dual-Core Processor Up to 2.60GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD",United States,"October 5, 2022",3.0

124,James Shoemaker,Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill. It came with Windows 11 which seemed to work well. Had no trouble with setup. It is lightweight and for a refurbished item. it looked brand new. My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming. It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine. It does not come with a CD/DVD player. I use flash drives to transfer data and programs.

125,SurGriffin,Works great. I got this a few months ago and it works fine. the screen is tearing /flickering but It was something I installed and not a hardware problem. But it works as expected.,HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States,"November 2, 2022",4.0
126,LV,"The machine itself seems pretty nice. It is way faster than my old machine. I was able to run two external monitors once I got the right cable. I'm not a gamer. I just run a few business applications.

Get the bigger disk. I got 256 and should have gotten the larger disk because after updating windows with all its patches I only have about 100GB free.

BEWARE OF THIS SELLER. I was very surprised to buy a ""new"" machine and find out when I got it that it was manufactured in 2020 and the HP warranty is already over. I contacted the seller to see if they would pay to extend the warranty and got no response from them or Amazon. Maybe buy this somewhere else or make sure you get a warranty included.",HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States,"August 28, 2022",4.0
127,Charles K. Foster,"I needed a new laptop for gaming, streaming, etc. I went with HP because my old HP laptop is 6 years old and still works fairly well and that impressed me that I was getting something new that would last awhile. But, as always happens, it had become frustratingly technically out-of-date for running some games and was also very slow due to low free memory. This new model is tons more powerful and triple the memory. I have yet to find a game I was unable to play on it and watching videos/streams is mostly without flaw. Battery life is not great, I would imagine because of the amount of energy it needs to be as cool as it is. This was not a deal-breaker for me because I really wasn't getting it for portable use anyway, so mine is always plugged in. 2 relatively minor issues I've had should be noted: The keyboard is backlit but this model turns off the backlighting after about 10 seconds of you not typing. As far as I'm concerned that defeats the purpose of the feature in that it doesn't remain constantly lit in the dark. There are no BIOS or other setting options to change this so it's a little annoying. Secondly, there seems to be a slight problem with the volume when watching movies off of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. At MAXIMUM speaker volume and MAXIMUM stream volume, the sound is acceptable but you can't get it any higher than an average output. It does NOT, however, have this problem when playing games, so I dunno what's up with that. I contacted HP about it, but they've never gotten back to me on it. I've found it to be a pretty minor annoyance though as if needs be I can still use my old laptop if I need to watch something at a louder volume. All in all, I'm pretty happy with this model, though I'll update this review if anything new, good or bad, comes up with it. I decided to wait 3 months of using it before offering my opinion, and there you have it. ;)",HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States,"May 27, 2021",4.0
128,Chris & Christy,"Laptop is great for gaming, and streaming however the battery on it is TERRIBLE. Unless it is plugged in, I get maybe two hours of usage out of it… and that’s pushing it.

130,Russell Sanders,"Let me start by saying it IS a laptop. I needed one to replace my aging laptop so that I could be up to speed since I am a college student, so it needed to have storage capabilities, speed, and be able to handle various processes with a decent battery. At moderate usage, the battery usually lasts about 5-7 hrs, having multiple tabs open, software compilers, etc. I strongly dislike MacAfee, so I uninstalled that right off the bat and use a different antivirus. This laptop is great for needing to be on the go since it is not large, and it also sports Wifi and ethernet ports, which can work in tandem with each other (connect to both at the same time). The RAM can also be upgraded, which I plan to upgrade the 4GB stick to an 8GB stick at some point.",HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States,"September 16, 2021",4.0
131,Justin LaReau,I liked this computer allot up until it just stopped working after 14 months. I purchased this computer for 2 purposes. First to work from home remotely during the pandemic and second to run CAD Software for my desktop CNC router. I did not use it for anything else and was extremely careful on what it was used for as well as kept it in emaculent condition. I also saved anything other than the necessary software on an external hard drive. After the 1 year manufacturers warranty expired the laptop would just freeze shortly after turning on and an error screen would show up. It forced me to restart the computer and the same thing would happen. I took it to two different IT experts both said there is something severely wrong with the hardware. They both tried everything they knew to fix the problem unsuccessfully. The computer is useless at this point. About 6 months after owning the computer very rarely the computer would freeze and would need to be restarted. This was so rare it wasn't really an issue and would always work after being restarted until one day after owning for 14 months or just locked up and wouldn't work. I factory reset it which was almost impossible given how it wouldn't work but was able to. My IT coworker tried reinstalling the driver software from Nvidia and he did a bunch of things I am not knowledgeable on to discuss. Moral of the story buy another brand as I am because I no longer trust the quality of HP. Which is sad because I try to support American companies and try to buy American made or American owned when the prior is not an option. I was a Mac/apple guy but most CAD SOFTWARE requires windows so I bought this HP as my first PC in over 15 years. I am considering going back to Apple as some CAD companies have software that can be run using a Mac.

132,Amazon Customer,My biggest dislike is Windows 10. This laptop is forcing me to develop new skills. It is a huge departure from the Vista OS that took me forever to become comfortable with. I bought this laptop to replace my old laptop because the Vista OS wasn't getting updates. I primarily use the laptop as a storage device for images and music. I am not a gamer other than The Solitaire Suite; which I like very much on this computer. I do surf the web and shop with the device also. I can't comment on the battery life or the gaming capabilities of this laptop. I really am not sure whether it is a good value. I know it cost more than I expected considering it doesn't have a DVD burner or player. I like and appreciate the upgraded Ram and Hard drive space compared to my old Laptop. I really didn't want to buy a laptop that relied on the cloud as I use the device in areas where I don't have internet access. Do I like it? Yes I do!,HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States,"July 24, 2021",5.0
133,justin ashley,"ive seen people say that the battery life isn't good, but I don't think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.
ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they'll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked. I actually prefer that to minimize battery use.
while using without gaming, the battery life is actually pretty good.
so far ive played terraria and fallout 76, and they both play great on ultra settings. I think im going to install battlefield 5 and see how it runs. not a big fan of the game itself, but that's the most resource intense game I own, kinda curious how itll run.
the laptop is more than vr ready
I love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing.
oh, ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving.... mine didn't either, YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY, LOL

It is lightweight and for a refurbished item. it looked brand new. My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming. It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine. It does not come with a CD/DVD player. I use flash drives to transfer data and programs. A 5 star buy.,HP-Pavilion-Micro-EDGE-Processor-15,United States ,"October 26, 2022",5.0
210,Jeremy,"This is my first Chromebook, and overall I’m quite pleased with the purchase. I’m mainly going to be using it for basic internet browsing and writing, so when I was shopping for the right model I was favoring cost, weight and battery life over other features like screen size and processing power. I ultimately felt this was the best balance of weight and battery life for the price. I definitely wasn’t wrong about the battery life. I’m amazed. This thing lasts and lasts. It’s not the fastest computer but it suffices for my use case.

Two things that bother me.

This first is the lack of an illuminated keyboard. I knew it lacked one going into it, so I can’t complain that much. I just didn’t realize how much I’ve come to rely on it on my other laptops. I’m often using the computer in dark environments, where it’s difficult to see the keys. Again, I knew this wasn’t an included feature, so this isn’t really a complaint as much as something to give extra consideration to before purchasing. With that being said, even with the lack of the illuminated keyboard, I don’t regret the purchase, and would buy again.

Which takes me to the second point. There is an issue with some of the video playback. In extra bright scenes in videos on YouTube and elsewhere, there is some discoloration in the highlights. Meaning, that in certain areas of the video, particularly that are white, there is some blue artifacts/pixelation happening. I have confirmed that this is an issue with this model and have seen it replicated in floor models at Best Buy and heard other people complain about this. I’m frustrated that HP has allowed this to continue to be a problem without offering a fix. As I said, most of my use cases involve writing; so video watching isn’t high up on my list of priorities. If it was, this would be a much bigger problem for me.

Overall, I’m pleased with the purchase given the price, and recommend it for anybody who is looking for an inexpensive, long battery life Chromebook option.",HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop,United States ,"May 29, 2022",4.0
211,Montana Guy,"I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars. So far, this fits the bill pretty well, with a few minor differences from the Macbook. It was really easy to set up and import my passwords, bookmarks, etc. which was really convenient. Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to. I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included. I also miss having iTunes (now Apple Music), but I switched to Spotify. There are a few little things that are different that I've had to get used to, but nothing too major. I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone, because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen, not a touchscreen (tablet) or a little tiny screen (phone) All in all, it's a great little laptop for the price.",HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop,United States ,"July 14, 2022",4.0

215,Gabriellia,"If you don't mind looking at a small, iffy quality screen, then this Chromebook is fine for you. If you increase the letters on the screen too large, then it negatively effects your webpages and how many tabs you can have open.

It is fairly quick for it's price point and allowed me to get schoolwork done when needed. I wouldn't feel bad if I cracked the screen or broke it a few years from now since the price isn't bad.

If these types of screens bother your eyes, I highly recommend IPS displays. You can get this same exact laptop but with an IPS display for only a few bucks more.

All in all, I decided to return it after my eyes were hurting from squinting at the screen. I went with a Lenovo Chromebook C330 11.6 inch ($180).",HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop,United States ,"September 15, 2022",3.0

219,Lee Haslup,"Update Below...First I should say that it's not the Chromebook's fault. It works fine as it was built. It's not the machine's fault that its model was built without a touch screen. I am a bit cranky with HP for making something of a big noise about their new 11a economy Chromebook with a touch screen... and then building a model of the 11a without one. If you go to the HP site and enter all twelve characters of the model number and ask for specs the specifications displayed won't mention a touch screen because the 11a-na0010nr doesn't have one. (The 11a-na0040nr does have a touch screen but the ...0010... does not.)
None of this changes the fact that the product is misrepresented. The listing describes the machine as
""...The powerful MediaTek mobile processor, full-size keyboard, and 11.6-inch touchscreen can handle it all. ... With an anti-glare, high-definition, 11.6-inch touch display, you can stream...""
So at two places in the ""About This Item"" text it promises a touch screen which the item does not have. Initially I thought about returning the machine but, on reflection, the lack of a touch screen is not a deal breaker. I decided that instead of returning the machine I would leave a one-star review instead.
UPDATE: Too many problems. Sending the Chromebook back. Problems that emerged since my previous review -- I can't make the SD card reader work. I can activate the device in the device settings but most of the apps don't see it. The settings for the individual apps don't show the card in the External Storage Preferences. Notably, Netflix can't see the card. You can't download much video to watch offline if you can't get to the SD card. Also, although the item was sold as new with a one year warranty, when I presented the serial number to the HP support page it informed me that the warranty was started in April of 2021 and expired this April just passes. So there is no warranty. Googling the support communities found only one thread discussing a similar problem (last month) but the only participant who resolved the problem did so by returning the machine.

222,Stacey Lynn Rhoades,"HP Chromebook didn’t work out of the box. There’s an error connecting to my WiFi network (even though it is, in fact, connected and works in guest mode). I never could get to the setup screens. Sent it away to HP to be fixed because it has a 30 day warranty. I’ll update my review whenever I’m able to use it.

Update: I received the CB back from HP, and the same problem is still occurring. I spent about 45minutes with their online support to be told it needs to go back to HP to be fixed. If it isn’t fixed this time, I’m returning it. Each time I speak with someone they ask me about upgrading my warranty, which is even more frustrating. Why should I pay more money to purchase a warranty on a product that has never worked when I can return it for one that does?

Update #2: After a month, my CB is working well. I really like it. Just wish it hadn’t taken a month to get it working. HP service was prompt and effective the second time around.

263,R. Prince,"My excitement for getting a Chromebook to still study and write when I'm too sick/tired to sit up was dampened considerably when this got here.

Basically, something is wrong with the screen. Not just in this one - the issue is still present even in the replacement that Amazon sent. It seems to have a problem with skin in particular, along with pale colors, and using the built-in ""night light"" feature or Screen Shader extension on Chrome to reduce blue light makes it worse. When watching videos, people will commonly have huge blotches of green pixels along their skin. And in normal windows, green lines and splotches will often appear for no reason at all.

Initially I tried talking to HP Support about the issue, and they actually tried to foist me off on a ""specialist"" that I would have to pay for - to get help on a brand new Chromebook that I hadn't even had for an hour yet! Thankfully Amazon support was more reasonable, and they simply offered to set up a return and send me a replacement in the meantime.

Unfortunately, the issue is persisting even in the replacement. I can only assume it's a common defect in this model now, maybe in some awful push to try and get people to buy the newer and more expensive one.

292,David Porter,"I owned this laptop for a month when it stopped working. After a few days of use, it started glitching and the screen would freeze multiple times a day. It would require needing to be restarted on a daily basis just so the laptop could become unfrozen. Assuming I may just had a bad computer, I reached out to the manufacture and they kindly offered to send a second laptop free of charge. The second laptop turned out to be worse than the first, however. After having that second laptop for less than a month it also stopped working. When looking at something with white in the web page, there would be what can best be described as blue scratch marks all over the screen. The company was nice, but I would not buy another chromebook from hp again. I previously owned a chromebook from Asus that cost half as much ($70 ish) but yet it lasted me 3 years. I wasn't able to even get 1 month out of BOTH of my hp chromebooks.

Now I bought the basic hp chromebook model without touchscreen. It is possible that the touchscreen version of this laptop avoids these issues. However, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop,United States ,"December 25, 2021",1.0

A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed.

Thankfully, HP and others have release newer models that utilize SD memory better (when used with the standard memory in the Chromebook). This particular model will share the 32gb SD card memory with the Google Play Store apps as well as allowing the user to dedicate memory specific to the Linux development environment.

If you had an earlier Chromebook (configured in development mode) and used Crouton with xfce, you may have been disappointed with some of the quirks of the Linux desktop if you needed it for applications that weren't available from Google (for your Chromebook) such as RealVNC for remote desktop applications. Thankfully, the model allow for more memory for the Linux applications. If you do choose to install the KDE desktop (I couldn't get Crouton to work) make sure you allocate 10gb (rather than the suggested amount) since the KDE desktop loads up several apps you may not need including LibreOffice.

The KDE desktop is very flakey to use but this Chromebook has a separate section for Linux apps that can be executed without loading KDE first (without the need for learning a new GUI) since this model utilizes virtual memory better between the two operating systems.

When installing RealVNC, this app has to be installed through KDE (using the .def file) through the terminal window. Once executed through KDE, the shortcut link to app resides in a the Linux app folder so that the separate Linux GUI no longer has to be executed first. It took me several hours to figure out the features but it is more reliable for hybrid work environments than the earlier generations used.

If you use Office, One Drive. or Nextcloud, these apps can be installed through the Google Play Store so that you can use them from your Chromebook as the app, rather than through the Chrome web browser (if you choose to do so).

If your phone doesn't have enough room for gaming apps, no worries. Many of the gaming apps can be downloaded from Google Play and execute from the Chromebook.

The battery life does last for 15 hours and has better execution and performance than earlier models.

Like most Chromebooks, it is lightweight and doesn't need a great deal of cables plugged into it. It does work with Chromecast and is available as an option if the Chromebook sees any on the same network it is connected to.

This model works with OpenVPN too without file conversion by downloading the app from the Google Play Store and using the nonwindows config files to operate.

I recommend using the USB 3.0, 1GB ethernet adapter from UGreen if you want to be a wired network. Those who live in tech areas like Seattle, the Bay Area, or the the Willamette Valley should know that the best security is wired internet to prevent any snooping over wi-fi.

There is no touchscreen on this model.",HP-Chromebook-11-inch-Laptop,United States,"June 29, 2021",5.0

413,Catherine,"I'm a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop ""work"" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.

About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the ""Windows 10-S."" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to ""Windows 11 Home,"" which is more capable of evading corporate MS's iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a matter of going into ""settings"" and changing it.

I do not mind the PC and MS ""marriage"" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).

As far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.
My overall opinion is ""nice."" It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a ""tuck it in the bag and go"" type computer.",Newest-HP-R5-5500U-Microphone-Windows,United States ,"July 9, 2022",5.0

This last time the screen wouldn't come back, and I had to turn off and turn on again.

Not reliable. I had it for a week only. I will be returning this.
I spent extra $100 and got a brand new one….

498,David M.,"I needed a new laptop computer just for general use and this one from Amazon seemed like it would do the job. So far I've been very pleased with the machine. I've been using it for web browsing using Chrome and some general light computing work and it has worked great.

I like the screen a lot. Text is clear and easy to read and 1920x1080 resolution is plenty for a screen of this size. It has been bright enough to use outside when I was working on setting up some networking equipment for a friend.

The keyboard and track pad both feel nice and work well. I wish the little bumps that identify the home row keys were a little bit larger but overall it is pretty good.

I have another 8GB of ram ordered so that I can have 16GB by just adding another card.
Yesterday I upgraded the memory to 16GB using a Crucial CT8G4SFRA32A. This plugged right in but in order to install the extra stick of memory I had to remove the back from the computer. I had to take out about 8 screws and then carefully pry off the back using a plastic spudger. All done with no problems but access could be easier.

This is my first machine with the Windows 11 operating system. Out of the box and in day to day use it has been very good. Adding my printers, applications and other stuff has been painless, sleep, waking up and overall power management has all worked well.

The computer didn't come with a huge amount of crapware to remove either. There were a few things like some McCafee stuff but nothing excessive.

I have not pushed the battery life all that much but so far it has been very adequate for my needs.

I've liked the machine well enough to order another one for a family member who needs a new Windows PC.

So far so good after a couple of weeks and well worth the money.",HP-Portable-Micro-Edge-Anti-Glare-14,United States,"November 13, 2022",5.0
499,shadowstar,"This doesn't have touch screen on my model. The FHD display really surprised me. It's better picture than a lot of these TVs. As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. As soon as the 33th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it's got a burnt pixel. No way to fix that without replacing the screen. Unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. HP is still shady in that regard. I fully upgraded the machine when I got it. 16GB ram, 1TB Samsung 980 SSD. The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. I have a Geforce 980, an octocore AMD CPU, and 24GB DDR3 ram in my tower. This laptop of course has a little less RAM, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. I really am surprised at this. The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 CM gap. There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just isn't room. They couldn't even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. I had problems with HP in the past, they screwed up a laptop return I sent in, then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures, so I'm not shocked at how they treat customers. I swore I'd not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up. It's super light weight. The camera is nothing fancy, in Windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. It's instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool. Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. You'll also want to get a good set of headphones. The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out. The machine simply wasn't designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. When you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you'll find it's incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI. It forces you to keep the screen open, which isn't good to have static screens. I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there isn't anything I can do about it. It isn't that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. I have a warranty but again, it's not going to cover this damage, so I spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen. The case is the cheapest plastic they could find. Given this was produced during the pandemic you're left with another problem. Check your RAM speeds. If you get stuck with a 1R16 chip you're basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2R8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. They don't mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you'll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. It's just too poorly designed. I give it a year or two before it fails. Most likely, knowing HP it will be 26 minutes after the OEM warranty expires. They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it's been nearly 8 years since I swore I wouldn't buy another one, they changed; for the worse.",HP-Portable-Micro-Edge-Anti-Glare-14,United States,"April 5, 2022",4.0
500,Katie,"So this was the first non high-end gaming laptop I've ever purchased, with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school, work, and general basic use. To be quite honest, it's surprisingly nice! After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a 15"" display from my previous 17"", the screen is of good quality. The processing speed is not disappointing at all. The sound is great (it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that). I don't find Windows 11 to be offensive to use. Keyboard is friendly. It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality (not super cheap feeling). It's light to carry. Loads videos and webpages quickly. No crashing or general use issues as of yet. I've even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it's running just fine. I'm really pleasantly surprised. And coming from someone who is used to a 5k+ Alienware Gaming Laptop (aka me), the fact that I don't hate this thing is truly impressive enough. If you pressed me to find something I don't love about it, I'd say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh. It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying. But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work, I plugged it in and hit the power button, only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it. So I am not even mad. No touch screen on my model. And I can't attest to it's gaming abilities because, well, I have an Alienware for that. Seriously though, best spent $400 ever.",HP-Portable-Micro-Edge-Anti-Glare-14,United States,"September 7, 2022",4.0
501,Elizabeth,"Ok so overall this laptop is a decent, practical, all-around laptop. Not great, but good enough. If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better.

If you’re like me, don’t have time to scout the internet, and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation, then it’s possible at some point you’re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you’ll accept only being reasonably happy with it (aka I settled).

Here is my observation of each aspect of the laptop:
* The screen quality is good, but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough, so I’m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment.

* The battery life is ok, lasting me about 7 hours currently. We will see how long that keeps up, as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about 1-2 years.

* The keys feel good to type on, which I was relieved to find.

* The speed of the laptop is only alright. For an SSD, I expected it to be faster. This machine will stream video just fine, but don’t plan on doing any video editing or gaming.

* The weight is actually very nice, but that should be expected with such a small screen.

* One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot, which I like. Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan, but this computer does not need that. I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm.

* Lastly, and unfortunately, the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable. At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings. But after doing so, I realized it is not a software issue.

The problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough. So in effect, what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad. That is fine when you’re moving the cursor large distances across the screen, but it means that fine, small movements are difficult to achieve. It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this.

Luckily, I came up with a solution. You will need to order a touchpad cover / skin for $10. They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones. It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface. This worked well. The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop, so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size.

Here are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks:

Fix screen settings:
right click on the desktop > show more options > AMD radeon software > display > reduce contrast to 94 > increase the brightness to 25

Fix touchpad by searching for this on amazon:

CaseBuy MacBook Air 13 Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skin

cut it down to size and install it

(make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don’t have any bubbles in it after you’re done)

After you’re done installing it, you’ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity.

Go to:
Windows settings > bluetooth & devices > touchpad > taps > touchpad sensitivity > high sensitivity

That’s all I’ve got. Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it. Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them.",HP-Portable-Micro-Edge-Anti-Glare-14,United States,"February 16, 2022",5.0
502,Murrayd,"I like how lightweight it is, the ram is upgradeable & so is the SSD drive! I have always been partial to HP; my last 4 computers have been HP's. I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too. It drains the battery faster than I would like, but it could be my settings, I will keep you all posted. Thank you, Amazon!!!
Additional Findings! A month in and this is what I discovered: When I ordered this laptop, I had two things in mind. # One is a backup computer for my desktop, I use it for my entertainment system, it is partly a backup Plex Server. It works great by the way. # Two I wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to a coffee shop and do whatever, as I enjoy my coffee outdoors. No complaints so far. I have since tweaked my battery settings and have literally increased my battery life by about 3 times between recharges. Go to YouTube and look up how to extend battery life on an HP Laptop and you will find helpful tips. I have no heat problem what so ever (some people have complained about that.) I upgraded the memory to 16 gigs and it is fast as all get out. So, hence my rating stays a 5 star! Keep in mind it is made of plastic, be gentle, if you wish to upgrade on your own, don't be a bull in a China shop. Yes, before you ask, you can hook it up to a large monitor and close the lid, it is in Windows settings, when in doubt YouTube is my go-to. I hope this helps I am happy to answer questions, if I can.

I was surprised to see next to no bloatware on my machine, though this could be due to the fact they do only give you a 256GB SSD. There is an expansion slot for a SD/Micro SD card, but the laptop does have an additional slot for another stick of RAM and you can swap out the included SSD with an upgraded one, provided you know how to do it or know someone that can do it.

If you upgrade to 16GB of RAM for dual channel mode and get a high performant SSD, then you get a lot more performance since Ryzen processors often work better with dual channel memory.

It’s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs, homework, web browsing, to even some gaming. I’ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested, but even just with the 8gb I’ve been able to run some lower spec games. Games like Sims 3/4/city, Bethesda games, age of empires, ALMOST everything I’ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles. Whether you’re looking for a cheaper option for playing games (don’t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings), a school laptop, or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on, this is a good contender for the price. The only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars are; the external hardware is nothing fancy, not bad quality just could be better, the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast, and the material the track pad is made of is not that great. Other than that, I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop.

EDIT: I have had it for like 4 months now. I still love it and all of this still remains true. I have played some better games on it as well, such as Ready or Not and Arma 3. Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions. Arma 3 runs like a charm 85% of the time.

however, after few months, i started noticing that every time i turned it on, the battery is dead. which makes the laptop unusable, especially for the purpose i got it for.
this week, i made sure to charge it to 100% and turned it off, so it is ready to be used when i needed it in case of emergency.

The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop. Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop.
Ok a little update. I do like this laptop a lot. I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn't work right out of the box. I'm dumbfounded by these reviews. The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself.
This device had a defective battery out of the box. I didn't notice that until after a few days. I contacted H P and they were great to work with. They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good. H P offered to replace the battery free, but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery. I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop. They weren't game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it.

I also do not need the app feature and find that most laptops and windows are going that route. It’s annoying.

620,David T.,"This is a great improvement over my ancient Dell D800. Because it runs Microsoft Windows as the operating system, the laptop requires about three minutes to start all of the basic services and processes before one can reasonably use it.

One issue: when plugging in a USB thumb drive, the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse did not function properly. I purchased a powered USB hub to resolve this issue.

Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi, they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one.

You have to either know how to use it, learn how to use it, or buy support. I've had this computer for 5 months and yes, yesterday I couldn't connect to Wi-Fi. Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty. (I didn't.) Started reading the reviews. But then I tried figuring out why my Wi-Fi isn't connecting (via my cell phone). It took a while, I learned a lot of computer innards, and after successfully connecting to Wi-Fi, I'm typing this review from it. Wi-Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop. The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program.

637,Karsten T. Brown,"When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.

First, the cons:
Is it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn't intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don't buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn't the brightest. The sound quality isn't immersive. There is no optical drive.

Now, the pros:
The price. This is a 15"" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn't for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn't super speedy, but it isn't unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn't buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.

Who should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.

[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn't?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.]",HP-Generation-i5-1135G7-Graphics-15,United States,"February 8, 2022",5.0

658,Chubb,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3. I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better. The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day. This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it. The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails. The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support. We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year. (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. At that point I was loud and angry. I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware. ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"". I said I would not pay such ransom ware money. I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"". I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.) An update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack. I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.) Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back.

Screen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting.

Computer is a little flimsy when folding/unfolding.

With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.

Fast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We've been using Dell but I figured I'd save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She's had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP's quality issues.

Unfortunately I can't return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it's time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.

889,C. Okamuro,"The product page for the HP 15-dy5024nr is unremarkable, in that it does not really let you know what product line this HP laptop is part of. It's also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are, without getting one.

For the curious, the loadout is as follows:
Intel Core i5-1235U - this is a 12th gen Alder Lake part with 4P cores (with HT), and 2E cores (10 threads)
WDC PC SN530 256GB - this is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD
8GB of DDR4 (ick)

The machine is pretty fast, but the 8GB of RAM is a strange choice, considering it's a 10T CPU. The screen is 1920x1080, and it appears to be an IPS panel. The screen is clear, but peak brightness is only average. The Xe IGP graphics are better than older Intel IGPs, but it's still not up to the level of what you'd get with an RDNA APU - much less a gGPU. If you're a gamer, you'll want to look elsewhere. The large 15.6"" footprint makes a large keyboard possible. The spacing is good, and the chicklet keys aren't bad, but you will get a get a decent amount of clatter and flex while typing. It's not a premium experience, but I still found it easier to type on this keyboard than on most laptops. The SSD, while a 4x unit, is about half the speed of ""nice"" PCIe 3.0 x4 units. I really didn't find it to be a bottleneck for normal business workloads, but it wasn't great when I would install massive NPM packages. The wifi capability is provided by a MediaTek MT7921 802.11ax. The card and onboard antennas work fine. Battery capacity is not stellar, and I would not expect to get more than 4 or 5 hours out of a charge. The power supply is physically tiny, with a 45W capacity. Unfortunately, there's no USB PD charging here. External connectivity consists of two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI port, a USB-C port, a combo headphone/mic jack, an full-size SD card reader. No Thunderbolt here. The front-facing webcam is better than some, but still not good. The speakers are top-firing, and are better than many in this laptop price class. By that, I mean that they get sufficiently loud. No, they're not great, but they're fine - perfectly adequate for YouTube, podcasts, and even the occasional Netflix movie.

At $625, this HP laptop is in a weird spot... It's definitely in a different performance tier than the $300-$450 laptops. It actually feels like a modded car... the CPU outclasses the rest of the machine, with the 8GB of RAM feeling like the biggest constraint. In reality, though, the 8GB is just fine for several browser tabs + Office 365. I've run several instances of VS Code at once, with Node+Express running in each. If you don't care about a machined aluminum case, an all-day battery, or a dGPU, and you JUST want good performance at the $625 price point, this is a great laptop.

This is not a gaming laptop. I installed the online game Runescape and it was able run ok but No Man’s Sky ran for a few seconds and shut down, probably due to a memory problem. With only 8 GB of ram and a 256 GB SSD, it is very limited. It is small, light and mostly plastic. There are no user serviceable panels to remove to upgrade ram etc. There is no user manual that I am aware of that explains how to do anything to this laptop.

To upgrade to 32 GB it will cost over $80. The SSD can be upgraded to 500 GB ($55) or 1 TB ($95). This laptop does not have a CD/DVD, Display Port or a USB port for charging the laptop. It does have a full size HDMI Port, a USB C 3.0 data port and 2 USB A 3.0 data ports.

904,David J,"This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use. The build quality is great with no issues. The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots. The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions.

The Intel Core i5-1235U packs enough processing power for it's intended usage, but only having 8GB of ram does bring some concern when considering long term usage. Windows 11 runs snappy and smooth with this configuration, but the drawback is you cannot upgrade the memory. This laptop as configured is more than enough power for daily task at home or at work. I did drop a star because of the inability to upgrade the memory. With that out of the way, this is a solid laptop.

Games can be played on this laptop, but be mindful of the specs. This is not intended to be a gaming laptop. Yes, it can play games, but it will not compete with a dedicated gaming laptop.

During long usage the bottom does heat up. It's as expected with this CPU, it's not a deal breaker. The battery life is good.

923,The Chief,"TL;DR:
--------
Decent entry level laptop with barely enough resources for basic computing. Plenty of the standard HP bloatware preinstalled. Only 8GB of ram and CANNOT upgrade! There are MUCH better options out there at this price point ($624)

REVIEW OF HP LAPTOP 15-DY5024NR
---------------------------------------------
This laptop is a bit disappointing for the price at time of review ($624). I was excited for the new generation of intel processors. So much power, even in the lower end processors. Unfortunately, processing power only gets you so far when multitasking on Windows. RAM is also a big deal if you want to multitask (like having multiple internet browser windows and a few other applications open at the same time)

So, to sum things up, here are my lists of pros and cons for this laptop.

PROS
++ Has WiFi 6, which is currently the top standard for consumer WiFi
++ 12th gen i5 processor has plenty of power for big chores

CONS
-- ONLY 8GB? Windows itself takes up about 4.4gb (~55%) without anything else running. Start adding applications and you will max out VERY fast. 8GB is simply not enough for basic computing in 2022.
-- Cannot upgrade RAM. Internals are not user serviceable. So, even if you wanted to upgrade, you would be risking your warranty. The back cover requires some surgery to remove!
-- Typical HP bloatware. Most of it you can just uninstall, but it is annoying that they still include all the advertising and bloatware out of the box.
-- Substandard screen. Lots of light bleed on the edges. Only 1080p and not touchscreen.
-- Not able to be powered through USB-C. This should be a no brainer for companies nowadays.
-- Overall feel is cheap. Touchpad, keyboard, casing, all of it just feels cheap.

Overall, I would not recommend this laptop unless you are only using it to browse the internet and check email. If that is all you need it for, then this might be a decent option. However, even then, at this price point, there are many other options out there to discover and research. I will tell you right now that I did a search for similar specs but with 16GB of RAM and came up with several other options that were equal or LOWER price than this.

Bottom line, if you do anything other than email and internet browsing, this laptop is NOT for you.",HP-Generation-i5-1135G7-Graphics-15,United States ,"September 22, 2022",1.0

926,Kate B.,"This laptop is great for those on a budget and need something to do the basics with like browsing the web, emails, videos etc. The laptop itself came packaged nicely to avoid any damage, once i got it out set it to charge for a couple hours. Setup was relatively easy took roughly about 30 minutes with some updates. Once setup was done did some browsing which was pretty smooth, watched some youtube videos and didn't have any issues. Processing wise it's not the best and would easily get bogged down if you are doing too much at once but for this price point it's a great laptop.",HP-Generation-i5-1135G7-Graphics-15,United States ,"September 29, 2022",1.0
927,Ivy D.,"The Good: Light to carry, easy to set up.

The Bad: The 8GB RAM that you cannot upgrade limits how useful this is for me. It's fine for some light web surfing and the occasional video, but anything more than that drains the battery very fast. I can't use it for any of my work because multi-tasking on this just does the same - not really designed to handle anything too taxing on the RAM.

The Bottom Line: It's a middle of the road for me. For entry-level laptop, It's ok for very light web surfing and basic functions but the limitations with the RAM make this hard to use for any heavy duty multi-tasking that I would need for work.",HP-Generation-i5-1135G7-Graphics-15,United States ,"October 11, 2022",1.0
928,Travis Merrell,"Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows.

The I5 processor is surprisingly good. Averaging only a 4٪ decrease in performance against the I7 model.

Not suitable for gaming IMO. But I would recommend to most pc users. Power users will know this is not what they are looking for.

929,"Peter M. Ross, Ph.D.","The C - unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller. I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for $900. It had instability: frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior. After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem (they convinced me not to return it), I had to leave the country for several months. The problem persisted. At some point, HP installed Win 11 surreptitiously. This stopped my microsoft programs from working (I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win10 and do not work in win11). I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support. They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows 11 to win 10 at no charge. I did not accept. In June, just before the warranty expired, I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months. I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise. This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess. This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business (the first was in 2007, and I gave them a second chance).

935,G. Gregory,"Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov 29th. Box was never opened until Christmas morning. Wife was thrilled. Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the 30th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection. I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead. I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken. The laptop has no ethernet ports. Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed. The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 MT7921 (2x2) and Bluetooth® 5.2 combo (Supporting Gigabit data rate) internal chipset. I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn't connect. I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning. After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network. As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point.
There's a lot to like about this laptop (excellent processor, good amount of ram, so-so SSD storage) but a lot to dislike about it also. No up-gradable storage or ram, no backlit keyboard, gray on silver lettering on the keyboard, no removable/swap-able battery (it's internal).
I have used HP products for 25 years and had my fair shape of issues with them but they have generally proven reliable. This is the poorest implementation of a $540 laptop I've ever seen. It's going back to Amazon for a full refund. I have seen others with the same issues on HP's support site and it's a relatively new laptop. What a waste of money, time and effort. HP, if your going to integrate everything in a throwaway design at least make it reliable for few years. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this for anyone.

I use it primarily for note taking, journaling, and household tracking (such as finances) through word and excel and for those reasons I love it. The camera is better than my old laptop but nothing stellar. I have not tried to stream video or used sound yet so I can't comment on that.

Usually, I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery. This is the second one, the first had a problem and had to be returned. There was some confusion with HP and Amazon, but Amazon came through for us. However, the return wasn't as smooth as most Amazon returns, possibly because it was a computer. It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don't shop at.

I was a Dell fan for many years and at first was hesitant to buy this HP Laptop, but ultimately decided to go for ir since it offered me a brand new machine with the screen size that I was used to, the latest software and processor generation available and more importantly a solid state drive. At this price I could only get older, used or refurbished laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer.
I waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I'm glad I waited and found this one for under $700.
I've been using this laptop for over 2 months now and I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything looks and works great, fast startup and shutdown and it doesn't get hot after many hours of continuous use.

HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way. The forward facing camera, while it appears to work just fine, it is NOT an ""IR"" camera and therefore, Windows can NOT log you in using the camera. So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I'll be typing in passwords and/or PIN's. Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP's literature. Seems a bit twisted to come pre-installed with Windows-11, but then due to a cheap, made in china camera, Windows ""Hello Face"" feature is completely unsupported. Would NOT buy this product again. Ever. This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this... A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more. And then to not be up front about this and kind of ""hide"" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least. Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using.

With a battery charged 100% the battery is exhausted in about 7 hours. For routine daily use you pretty much have to leave the laptop plugged into the charger.

I previously wrote the above review. I must change it. I consider this laptop to be a REAL LEMON. STAY AWAY. While recognizing that Windows 11 is yet another Microsoft upgrade, it must be loaded with undocumented features, i.e. bugs. Seems that anything you try to do invariably brings up an offer for product purchase or requires a password.

1065,FluffyTailedFox,"This laptop is great for getting clerical work or simple tasks such as web based business or office products completed. I'd say the only real drawback is the screen quality. It looks rather washed out, but otherwise it works great for what I need it to do. Great for work, good for watching videos, and naturally, bad for video games with the exception simple pixel or old indie games. It also doesn't have a SD card reader built in, but you can get a usb adaptar for that. If you are going to process a lot of data at one time, such as large databases or many browser windows, I suggest upgrading the RAM to 12 or 16GB as the 8GB it comes with gets eaten up quickly. It is a simple and inexpensive upgrade and HP made accessing it easy.

1072,Michael Neddo,"Okay, so normally not a big believer in brand new, basic laptops. Like cars, I would prefer to buy a higher spec laptop that is a few years old for the same amount of money. However, when this came up on Prime Day as a flash sale for Prime members, I threw caution to the wind and recklessly spent my hard earned money on something that inflation had not yet seem to hit!

Unpacking: Packaged like a refurb. Generic cardboard box with plastic wrapped laptop in foam holders, the AC adapter and two pieces of written documentation. That's it. No pretty outer box with all the specs, fancy pictures of even color. Though it looked like a refurb package, unit was in fact brand new. They didn't waste money on fancy packaging, which let's be honest, you don't need anyway.

First Impressions: This thing is BIG. A 17"" screen with 3/4"" bezels on all sides is hard to imagine until you are holding it. Small, svelte and built for the road warrior this thing is not!

Build quality: Okay, here is where the budget starts to shine through. The entire case looks like beautiful brushed aluminum...until you feel it. There is no mistaking this, it is the thinnest plastic that would hold the finish and provide a wet noodles worth of structural integrity. There is greater than expected flex to the chassis, the joints where the plastic panels meet feels like an old ""snap tite"" model and you just know that scratches and wear are going to be apparent in short order. I am now searching for a case, if they even make them for this as it appears to be a new model. This is a laptop that will feel more at home being a desktop replacement than your sidekick on roadtrips.

Ports/Access: The box says seven ports, which is par for the course, but the composition of them again points to a budget price point. Standard USB, check. HDMI, check. Card reader, check. USB-C, nope. Separate headphone and microphone jacks, nope. And oh my, when was the last time you saw a wired ethernet port with the expandable ""jaw"" that opens to allow that massive plug? That is going back to pre wi-fi days. A USB-C and separate jacks for mic and audio would have been welcome in lieu of that wired ethernet jack. Again, though, this is a budget laptop and I will not fault the omissions at this price point. On that note, when I opened the laptop, I was pleasantly surprised by what appeared to be a fingerprint reader above the ESC key! Upon further examination, the ""reader"" turned out to be the physical power button and the only thing it will do with your finger is cycle up and down to turn the pc on and off. Also, in today's age of USB-C options, it would have been nice to see the AC port use the USB-C interface instead of the proprietary ""blue tip"" adapter that HP has been using for generations now. I guess the good news is that if you have a blue tip or three laying around, you have plenty of spare adapters.

Function: Windows 11 boots right up and for those uninitiated to it, looks eerily similar to Apple's OS series. The bottom task bar is now a ""dock"" and quick launch icons are centered in it now. With 4 GB of RAM, an 11th gen i3 processor and onboard video being handled by Intel (and sharing in that massive 4 GB system RAM) this is not your gaming laptop. In fact, you may or may not realize that for the cost of a good graphics card today, you could easily buy two or three laptops like this for the price of a good GPU. Stick with Hearts, Solitaire and Minesweeper and you will be fine. I do not game, my work is office production and work related so I doubt I will tax the GPU and be very happy with what I find. Overall, the laptop feels quick as expected for ordinary tasks, web surfing and production apps.

Sound: Like TV's, the speakers are there for the most basic sound you can tolerate. If audio quality above the intense sound of an angry hornet in a tin can is what you crave, grab your headphones or external speakers and rock on.

Keyboard: As is common today, ""chiclet"" keys with separate number pad to the right. For all of the real estate this size laptop creates, anything less than full size keys would be criminal (and comical in appearance). The keys have a nice feel to them. They are not cherry switches, but they do have tactile ""thumps"" when typing and don't feel like you are typing on top of foam rubber. Something I have become very accustomed to and greatly miss is a lighted keyboard. Unless I just cannot figure out how to turn it on, which I doubt. Suspiciously, every function key has an alternate function (like brightness up/down, volume up/down, track skip, play, and even airplane mode) EXCEPT for f5 which has no alternate function whatsoever. This is the typical location for keyboard light so it appears to be MIA. Again, for the price, not going to complain, and given that this is more a desktop replacement than a road warrior, it should not impact most users anyway.

Noise: You can always tell an older laptop by the amount of time the fans kick up in speed when using it. For most newer laptops, rarely do you hear the fans spool up as the hardware can handle most standard tasks. The older the hardware gets, the more it gets tasked by updated apps and requirements, the more the fans spool up to accommodate the higher energy draw and load. I have yet to hear anything but a whisper from this laptop.

Screen: No, it is not a touch screen. Yes, the panel exhibits a lot of variation when viewed from any angle other than directly looking at it. I would say the direct zone is about 45 degrees total from left to right before you get very noticeable color and brightness variations. If more than one person is viewing (or you let your kids use it in the car) it is best used by at most, two people sitting very close.

Wrap Up: As with most anything in life, it is a balance of cost vs benefit. As I sit on this laptop and do this review, it is clear to me what HP focused on (and what they purposely left out) to provide a laptop at this price point. As a desktop replacement (complete with physical ethernet jack), this unit excels at a large display, a decently tactile keyboard, plenty of ports for common use, and sufficient hardware to meet the expectations of the production/surfing/simple web based gaming crowd. It will also please the occasional trip to the back porch for morning coffee while perusing your favorite blog. But start to travel a lot with this, putting it through the torture of soft sided cases, airport screeners or even just riding shotgun to and from work on a regular basis, it appears the chassis will quickly fall behind the performance of smaller display units or units made from actual brushed metal.

I have another HP with a touch screen, metal case, double the memory and double the capacity SSD in it. If I factor price out of the equation, this laptop is less than satisfying. If I factor in the price and realize that the laptop I am comparing this one to is FOUR TIMES times more expensive, I am quite happy with the serviceability and performance of this!

1149,SimpleGuy,"First, it's an HP. I have come to trust HP for reliability and price. It's a little slow for me because it only has 4GB of RAM, which I knew when I bought it so I'm not faulting them. It has a SSD, which is only what I buy now. Boot time is faster and things run faster for me with a SSD. Screen is excellent in size and display.
Only real issue I had was not with the product, but with shipping. Normally Amazon wraps the heck out of things but not this time. I'm glad HP had it securely packaged but Amazon put it in another box with absolutely no padding. When I picked it up the inner box was just bouncing around inside. Who knows what it endured on it's way. Thankfully there doesn't seem to be any damage thanks to HP packing it well.
Highly recommend this laptop if you just need something to browse the internet and do some other tasks. It's not a gaming computer so don't expect it to be. All in all, I'm happy with this.",HP-Generation-Graphics-Bluetooth-17,United States,"July 15, 2022",5.0

It works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department. I might have wished for USB ports -- but so far I have no reason to use them.

Apparently, this true of --any-- HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard, and it wiii be a bear to replace! I hope it has a very long life!

1432,Ryck,"It arrived very well packaged due to its characteristics, it is a very well optimized Chromebook, in addition to the fact that it is aesthetically very beautiful, elegant and super thin, in the description it indicates it has a Celeron processor but reviewing it it has a pentium N5030 with 4 cores and with its 4gb of ram It works perfectly for office automation, multimedia, video games, etc., you can edit your documents in Googledocs or Office, the only thing is that in the description it says with a Backlit keyboard and it is not like that, it has Wi-Fi 5 and 2.4, Bluetooth, the keyboard comes without the ñ but It's no problem, you just use Alt+n on the extended US keyboard so as not to lose the configuration. A device that is worth one hundred for what you pay and although it is renovated, it comes with new aesthetics and functionality and with updates until June 2026, I think you can do a little more with this laptop going from the average user, totally recommended for office work, school and video games.
