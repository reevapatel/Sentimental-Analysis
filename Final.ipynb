       "'i do audio work for video games: creating sfx in a daw(digital audio workstation) and or composing midi mockup scores using kontakt and a ton of heavy ram use orchestral sample library. the 32g ram on this and the 1tb ssd is a HUGE boon for audio work! i use both ableton and reaper daw. they load super snappy. my kontakt heavy projects load ultra fast now (versus the pc tower i was using, which was still quite powerful).\\n\\nthe laptop runs fairly quiet even at heavier cpu loads. i composed a piece of music for a game of thrones video game which ran about 60-70% cpu on my other, fastest computer(the pc tower). this hp laptop, it clocks in at a cool 50%. so ive been able to have tons of cpu intense plugins (such as ozone8 or reaktor) running in the daw projects no problem. i was able to turn the cpu down to 0% in the windows power management panel and set the cooling to passive- which causes the laptop to run slower, but basically run silent because less heat generation. which is perfect when i need to record foley or my own voice for use with creatures in the games. i can then turn the cpu back up to full speed when composing or integrating the sound and music into the games.\\n\\nthe graphics card on this isnt 100% the best but im still able to run unity and hook up sounds into 3d games that way without any lag via a 2k screen. really this isnt a gaming pc (only due to the level/integration of its graphics card) like you might not be able to easily run the latest greatest fps at full settings and stream on twitch at the same time without some drop in frame rate(but who knows maybe u can? i didnt test this fully), but im confident you could still run just about any game regardless (w tweaked setting most likely).\\n\\njust as a test i loaded up one of my all time fav games: skyrim, and one of the heftier mods and it seemed to run amazingly well in 2k (with all the game\\'s graphics settings turned up). i havent tried video capturing a game like that but with the right settings in obs i think it could work fine (probably no more than 60fps id imagine).\\n\\ni do do a lot of video capturing for my job: getting animations and vfx clips to bring into the daw to make sound effects with and so far this laptop does not even blink w those basic vid cap tasks.\\n\\ni also do photography and video editing on the side for my own projects. photoshop runs like a total breeze on this! ive never had a smoother photoshop experience, personally. after effects is fast to edit/splice preview etc but some of the render times (especially when using twixtor) still take time. a 20 minute time stretched(200% vector blend) 2k video with color correction and film grain layers added took about 2+hr to render. so obvs not the best laptop out there for major video effects work but i think still totally doable and capable for those working more in the premiere type video editing layout arena.\\n\\nmy only complaint is that the laptop feels cheapo plastic (this is my first non mac in a while so theres that) so for work-traveling(which is why i ultimately got this) i think ill need to get a good solid case and just treat this like a newborn baby during its life span.\\n\\nwith the crazy power of this thing, given the requirements of my audio/photoshop work, i think this will be a super solid computer for me for the next 10years at least. and for $800 what a crazy steal! I\\'ve had this laptop for a week now, which has been enough time for me to gauge my issues with it:\\n\\n- - Speaker volume auto-adjusts (video footage provided) - -\\n\\n(Okay so I figured this first one out, so skip this paragraph, unless you have the same issue, cuz I\\'ll mention my solution at the end of it.)\\n\\n~~I\\'ve troubleshooted this through every process suggested online, and can\\'t seem to find a solution or explanation. Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it\\'ll cut to a lower volume and then stay there. And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again, it\\'ll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume. This happens exclusively with the speaker, as in the headphones work just fine. I\\'ve turned off enhancements, changed every setting in the control panel sound settings, options sound settings, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled B&O. Nothing fixes the issue, and it\\'s very noticeable. I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers (the volume fluctuating is that noticeable).~~\\n\\n... Okay, so I figured that out. I needed to go to \"device manager\" and instead of trying to update the audio driver by searching automatically for one, I had to instead search for one that came already downloaded on the computer. In this case, what fixed my problem, was setting the audio driver to the HD one, and then going back to the control panel speaker settings, and going to the enhancements tab (that wasn\\'t present before to turn off all enhancements. This 100% fixed the stupid auto volume adjusting crap. (The default audio driver just sucks, not having much needed options.)\\n\\n- - Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it\\'s hard to see regardless, with heavy resistance - -\\n\\nNow I wouldn\\'t mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing. But in this case, the keyboard does not have lit keys, has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it\\'s hard to make out what they keys are, and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press. Think of like a membrane keyboard, but just a little more resistant than that. Very clicky/noisy too. It doesn\\'t feel great, but I could probably get used to it all.\\n\\n- - 6-bit color bit depth? - -\\n\\nI do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use (phone and computer monitor). Then when I found that the display was set as a 6-bit color bit depth, I realized that this might be the reason why. After searching all around online to see if this was changeable, I\\'ve concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself. Not the best, and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed.\\n\\nAnd then here are some non-issues that I\\'ve faced (as in things I\\'ve been frustrated with, but it\\'s not that big of a deal).\\n\\n- It comes preloaded with Windows 11 (I just downloaded 10 and did a fresh reboot with that)\\n- Battery life isn\\'t the greatest, but I wasn\\'t expecting much in that department\\n- So much bloatware, but I guess that\\'s more the fault of Microsoft than HP, since Windows 10 includes all kinds of useless crap (that I spent roughly 6 hours removing)\\n\\nEverything else has been great. If I can just get used to the keyboard (the placement of every key, and the \"weight\" of them), then this seems like a purchase generally worth $880. I\\'ll just have to accept less than ideal color depth (it\\'s not that bad tbf). I wouldn\\'t mind spending a couple hundred more to fix these issues, and maybe have separate action keys that aren\\'t the same as the function keys (since I use those quite often). I might consider that, but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school and just other things outside my room, which I know this will suffice for a good while. Its a pretty good laptop very fast and good with games. But have problems with short battery and also wifi connecting issue No Backlight on the keyboard and the keys are black with dark grey writing. Very hard to see at night etc. Has windows 11 which isn\\'t my favorite. Some bloatware. Otherwise so far so good, good value. This is by far the fastest laptop I have ever owned. It starts up very quickly and shuts down quickly. When you open an excel file, the file opens before the click of the mouse fades away.\\n8 core processer\\n32 GB of memory\\n1 TB solid state drive\\nExtended display with little display border\\nNice display\\nVery thin and light\\nThe people who put in the upgrades must have used soft gloves because the computer did not have a scratch on it and started up as a brand new computer.\\n\\nAll for $910 including tax is an incredible value.\\n\\nI do agree with one reviewer that the letters on the key could be more white if color to see them easier, but that is such a minor issue to all of the plusses.\\n\\nIf your current laptop has become sloe for you, this is a great replacement at a more than reasonable price. It worth The Ryzen chip is very fast and there is no lag with the video response with the onboard Radeon graphics. I\\'m thrilled with the 32 GB of RAM and the 1 TB SSD It\\'s an incredible little powerhouse and clearly with the $899 price tag. My only problem with the computer is the poor design of the keyboard !!! Okay, I knew going in that the keyboard wasn\\'t BACKLIT, but I never thought they would be STUPID enough to have BLACK keys with CHARCOAL LETTERING !!! It makes it nearly impossible to use in low-light environments. I had to resort to propping a small flashlight against my head and shoulder to illuminate the keyboard adequately to see what I was typing. I( later ordered a USB LED light to provide the light source, but really ... WHY NOT A BRIGHT WHITE LETTERING ON THE BLACK KEYES ??? SMFH I bought this laptop for scientific computing, and I was waiting for one with an 8-core processor for parallelized computations. When I saw a Ryzen 8-core processor, 32 GB RAM, and the price, ~$900 before tax, it ticked. This HP-Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency. I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica (the software I use for computations) and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison. At the same time, the laptop does not consume much energy, its power adapted is small. I run a parallelized computation using all 8 cores for hours and the laptop\\'s body is only a little bit warm. I do not hear any sound of the fan. This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i7 processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card, no expensive Nvidia that I don\\'t need. Comparable gaming laptops (8 cores) on Amazon cost twice as much.\\n\\nI haven\\'t found any serious drawbacks yet. A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within, the body of this laptop and its keys are gray, while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish. With low light, you don\\'t see them well, and you cannot work at night without a light. The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop (Intel i5, also energy efficient and overall good) that has a black surface and keys, white key inscriptions, and keyboard illumination. I like this HP Pavilion. I\\'ve owned several HP computers and printers before, I\\'m currently using an HP printer and this computer is the one I\\'m now reviewing. It works great, I\\'m able to type this review with no worries, there have only been a few minor glitches, all fixable by me. So far at least. HP has a lot of great support services in general, and this hard drive is just under one terabyte, they never seem to make it up to the full hard drive status they advertise. And I\\'m worried about defragmenting the drive, it\\'s a solid state drive and you can\\'t really defragment a drive of that type without harming the machine. Or the hard drive. So I\\'m hoping it will be okay, and I can manage without using defragmentation services. I\\'ve had this computer for a couple of weeks now. I paid about $1000 including tax (CA). Not a lot of computer makers offer a Ryzen 7-5700U, yet. With 32MB of RAM and 1TB SSD it\\'s almost a steal.\\nIt doesn\\'t offer frills like folding back the display, touch screen, or lighted keys. But what I would have liked is Windows 11 Professional instead of Home and School.\\nI made it dual boot, and installed openSUSE Leap 15.3 next to Windows. The dual boot works fine. However, I haven\\'t been successful yet getting the Ryzen to work at full resolution. That\\'s not HP\\'s fault, but rather AMD which doesn\\'t provide its Radeon drivers as public domain.\\nOverall, so far I\\'m happy with this computer. I hope it will last a long time. Everything is great, only the color of the keyboard is a little uncomfortable. Bought this for our son for college but hasn\\'t been used much yet. He seems pleased with it so far. Mic doesn\\'t pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera, but it is faster than the Ryzen 5 I murdered, lighter weight, too. I thought I would miss my 17in screen, but 15in is okay since the resolution is good. laptop looks great screen is worderfull specs are great and gives power no backlite to see keyboard but overall laptop is great I have had the laptop for a few days and I am pleased with what I have experienced thus far. The body is rigid, The performance speed is impressive. I recommend it without hesitation. good quality and good value for money Very cheap amazing laptop for work. I use this laptop for coding and it is very efficient at the job! It\\'s amazing how a 32gb, 1tb ssd, 16 core laptop can be this cheap! The only thing I find a bit annoying is that I need to charge at least once a day for my 9-5 job, but I guess it is expected due to the high end requirements. A laptop with excellent capacity... the games and programs run very well, I can work comfortably without it crashing It was nice to find this laptop with upgraded RAM. I needed a new laptop for the graduate level. I do mapping and basic photogrammetry, so I\\'ve just installed AutoCAD, ReCap, QGIS, and Metashape. So far, everything has been running smoothly. Although the fan begins to sound, I think is normal. I purchased this in March. Right away, the unit was going to sleep an I could only wake it by using the power button to turn it off and on; a 5-star HP tech fixed that. A couple of weks ago it started freezing and turning off. After several hours on a bad phone connection, they decided to send me a USB recovery drive, which wiped Windows and all the applications. After doing that and reloading the apps, it started again. This time it was shutting down because of Windows errors. Finally, Microsoft told me that it was no-doubt a hardware issue, but showed me how to reload Windows 11 in a way that would keep my files and apps in place. Told me that should fix it, unless it is a hardware issue. Didn\\'t work. I leave for an hour, come back, and it\\'s re-booted. I\\'m a small business man that relies 100% on my computer. HP\\'s solution is to send me a postage-paid box for me to pack the computer and send back to them so they can repair it. Meantime, I\\'m left without a way to communicate with and service my customers. I used to use HP inkjet printers. They were good for about a year before dying. I\\'m through with HP. Bought myself a nice Lenovo for a great price at Costco today. Anybody wants a doorstop - you can have one - just pay the postage I am very satisfied with this product.\\n- Quick Start Up, thank for SSD drive\\n- Fast performance, thank for Ryzen 7\\n- Great for multi task, 32GB RAM\\n- Battery last for a long time Excellent equipment, it is quite fast, the screen resolution is very good, aesthetically it is very beautiful, super light in weight I use the laptop for PowerPoints, projection, Xcel, etc. Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great. Not a single complaint. Love it! Very fast and loaded with all the Hp & MS Windows & Office tools to get up and running. To fast and good quality I don\\'t recommend this computer. I am having lots of issues with connecting to WiFi at my house. The old computers located in the same area as this new laptop are connecting as expected. I work in a hybrid role, and I need this laptop to be able to connect to WiFi wherever I am.\\n\\nI guess I\\'m going to have to take this to the shop since I\\'m outside the return period. Do not buy this computer from this seller.\\n\\nYou have been warned. We ordered a unit with Win 11 Pro. 64 bit\\nWe received Win 11 Home will not work with our software, so we sent it back THE FBA SELLER HAS NOT CALLED ME (AS PROMISED BY AMAZON) AND I AM UNABLE TO REACH THEM. THE VIDEO CAMERA (FOR ZOOMS) DOESN\\'T WORK AND THEY REVISED THE SOFTWARE BUT AMAZON IS SAYING TO CONTACT HP! DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZING WAREHOUSE DEALS! Arrived on time and safely packaged. The outer box was heavily damaged but thanks to the good packing job there wasn\\'t a dent or scratch on the actual packaging. The laptop itself is pristine, to the point I was doubtful of the claimed upgrades but everything checked out as advertised.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure how much difference I would see in speed but this is lightning fast and very responsive. The touch pad and keyboard are crisp and smooth, the display is excellent for 1080. The OS is Windows 11 home and I\\'m pleasantly surprised how decent it is.\\n\\nOverall very pleased with the purchase so far. Thanks for the support during installation... I love for the fact that its very fast, monitor is super clear, keyboard is good other than its lightweight and the price it very considerate. It\\'s a awesome... Truly appreciated. I am pleased with this one. Bought it to do some development on and it\\'s handling things nicely. I trade stocks and crypto, so it works great for that. I can send all my crypto into my cold wallet and not worry about it being lost on an exchange. The computer is amazing, however there are manufacturer issues and in order to resolve you have to downgrade your windows. I\\'m a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop \"work\" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.\\n\\nAbout the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the \"Windows 10-S.\" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to \"Windows 11 Home,\" which is more capable of evading corporate MS\\'s iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a matter of going into \"settings\" and changing it.\\n\\nI do not mind the PC and MS \"marriage\" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).\\n\\nAs far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.\\nMy overall opinion is \"nice.\" It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a \"tuck it in the bag and go\" type computer. This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost. It’s a beautiful color and it has a clean look. My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it’s great for the price. This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose, and homework. The vaule is good for the money spent. The one we got is not touch screen. We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it, but I restart it and then have no problems after that. It is also good speed computer. We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well. Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn’t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems I needed a PC just for internet browsing, email and the like.\\nFor just over $200 delivered, this PC fills the bill.\\nIt may be a refurb but mine looks like new - not a scratch or ding anywhere.\\nThere\\'s a camera, but no touchscreen.\\nThere\\'s Windows 11; it took about an hour to update the year-old build.\\nIt\\'s fast enough for my purposes.\\nAnd it looks good, too, not nearly as pink as in the pictures. I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do. touch screen works perfectly. This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I\\'m very happy with it for the price. Wasn’t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability (thank god), when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen. Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that’s what I’ve been using it for. This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials. The computer operates great and has no issues. Great product! Excellent product & touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop. The size is great, it’s in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this. And Pink! light weight, easy to use I like the slim design of the HP Laptop.\\nIts very light, no extra battery to replace.\\nEasy to do work on, battery life is excellent so far.\\nScreen quality is great, sound quality is also very nice\\n\\nI love mine The laptop is light and very sleek. It doesn\\'t run slow. It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices. I play games sometimes and it doesn\\'t lag. FYI No this is not touch screen. The laptop came with the charger. I’ve had it for about two months. So far so good. I don’t use it for gaming or anything like that. Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media. This computer is sleek & modern looking. I only use it for chrome and Google drive documents (may need 2-4 open at a time). It loads sooooo painfully slow that I almost can’t do what I need to do. So you get what you paid for. But the color is cute. Very easy to use. Quite fast. Excellent for the money. Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos, play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work. Great laptop and a terrific price. I am very pleased with my laptop. Delivery was prompt, and the laptop was in excellent condition. It was very easy to set up. For the price it\\'s a great deal As functional as it is beautiful. It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds! A great buy! When the computer arrived I carefully took it out and tried to power it on it didn’t turn on so I placed it on the charger for 30mins to an hour and it still wouldn’t power on. After further investigating the issue I noticed that the light didn’t even come on whenever I had it plugged in charging. I thought maybe something happened to my outlet I had it plugged into so I tried four more different outlets throughout my house. Still no light came on indicating that it was getting power to it to charge. It had a sticker on the box as seen in one of the picture that I took that the computer had been tested for full functions and was ready for reuse! That’s a lie! I’m highly disappointed and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save yourself the time and trouble and avoid this product. exellent product good quality I love the touch screen the most! Lol but overall great investment! The computer works just fine, but I cant activate Windows 11 due to no windows product key. Love this computer. Work great! Love the color. I didn’t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised. Easy to start up walks you right through start up. Great price. I received this laptop in great condition, however it didn\\'t come with a charging cable. My only option was to return the entire thing/get a replacement or buy a cord separately. I didn\\'t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included, and I saw other customer photos that included it. I\\'m annoyed that I\\'ll have to pay for one separately, or go through the hassle or returning and recording it. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen. Turns out it was too good to be true. That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download, videos I watch, or updates I complete. They lied to most of us or they’re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color. Low cost. Works good. Would buy again. It\\'s great. Better than my old one. Great for the money spent. Haven’t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home, and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though. I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too. My laptop stopped working exactly 6 months after purchase. Never will purchase another refurbished pc. First and last. Avoid refurbished. Nothing is able to be saved on this computer. I\\'m returning it.\\nRecommend DI NOT BUY. I love the color the screen looks excellent but it is too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished.\\nVery upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already.\\n\\nWhile I was working, it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere ( see pics)\\nIt happened multiple times!\\nThis last time the screen wouldn\\'t come back, and I had to turn off and turn on again.\\n\\nNot reliable. I had it for a week only. I will be returning this.\\nI spent extra $100 and got a brand new one….\\n\\nToo risky! At first it was taking forever (3mins and a blank screen) to log in. I was ready to take it back. Then I tried to update and restart, then it started up right away. Hopefully this can handle my daughter\\'s first year of college! So far, not bad for price. The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor. Arrived like new. Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work , was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid. It is a great little laptop. I love finding these great buys in the refurbished/renewed shop Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great product.\\nThanks This is not a touch screen computer. It doesn’t say it in the description. The comments made me think so. It came in perfect condition basically brand new. A little slow but very worth it! I’ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it’s literally a steel I love it. It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer! Easy set up and love the color Great purchase. Was a little scared at first to get but I’m happy I did. To replace a later hp laptop. Needed something smaller. More for ME!! I\\'m very satisfied. Not a single scratch or issue. Beautiful color also. 😍 This product came in impeccable condition! I was a tad bit surprised that the color popped so nicely. The system runs very well. I am very impressed with this lightweight laptop as I travel a great deal for business. Great computer. 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, extra storage slot. Battery lasts a very long time. I have Windows 11...which works great!! i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy. It’s a keeper for sure. Price can’t be bet. Works great. I got this a few months ago and it works fine. the screen is tearing /flickering but It was something I installed and not a hardware problem. But it works as expected. My biggest dislike is Windows 10. This laptop is forcing me to develop new skills. It is a huge departure from the Vista OS that took me forever to become comfortable with. I bought this laptop to replace my old laptop because the Vista OS wasn\\'t getting updates. I primarily use the laptop as a storage device for images and music. I am not a gamer other than The Solitaire Suite; which I like very much on this computer. I do surf the web and shop with the device also. I can\\'t comment on the battery life or the gaming capabilities of this laptop. I really am not sure whether it is a good value. I know it cost more than I expected considering it doesn\\'t have a DVD burner or player. I like and appreciate the upgraded Ram and Hard drive space compared to my old Laptop. I really didn\\'t want to buy a laptop that relied on the cloud as I use the device in areas where I don\\'t have internet access. Do I like it? Yes I do! The machine itself seems pretty nice. It is way faster than my old machine. I was able to run two external monitors once I got the right cable. I\\'m not a gamer. I just run a few business applications.\\n\\nGet the bigger disk. I got 256 and should have gotten the larger disk because after updating windows with all its patches I only have about 100GB free.\\n\\nBEWARE OF THIS SELLER. I was very surprised to buy a \"new\" machine and find out when I got it that it was manufactured in 2020 and the HP warranty is already over. I contacted the seller to see if they would pay to extend the warranty and got no response from them or Amazon. Maybe buy this somewhere else or make sure you get a warranty included. ive seen people say that the battery life isn\\'t good, but I don\\'t think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.\\nive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they\\'ll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked. I actually prefer that to minimize battery use.\\nwhile using without gaming, the battery life is actually pretty good.\\nso far ive played terraria and fallout 76, and they both play great on ultra settings. I think im going to install battlefield 5 and see how it runs. not a big fan of the game itself, but that\\'s the most resource intense game I own, kinda curious how itll run.\\nthe laptop is more than vr ready\\nI love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing.\\noh, ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving.... mine didn\\'t either, YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY, LOL\\noh, and I also received the laptop within a day and a half. ordered friday night, and got it sunday.\\noverall I highly recommend I needed a new laptop for gaming, streaming, etc. I went with HP because my old HP laptop is 6 years old and still works fairly well and that impressed me that I was getting something new that would last awhile. But, as always happens, it had become frustratingly technically out-of-date for running some games and was also very slow due to low free memory. This new model is tons more powerful and triple the memory. I have yet to find a game I was unable to play on it and watching videos/streams is mostly without flaw. Battery life is not great, I would imagine because of the amount of energy it needs to be as cool as it is. This was not a deal-breaker for me because I really wasn\\'t getting it for portable use anyway, so mine is always plugged in. 2 relatively minor issues I\\'ve had should be noted: The keyboard is backlit but this model turns off the backlighting after about 10 seconds of you not typing. As far as I\\'m concerned that defeats the purpose of the feature in that it doesn\\'t remain constantly lit in the dark. There are no BIOS or other setting options to change this so it\\'s a little annoying. Secondly, there seems to be a slight problem with the volume when watching movies off of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. At MAXIMUM speaker volume and MAXIMUM stream volume, the sound is acceptable but you can\\'t get it any higher than an average output. It does NOT, however, have this problem when playing games, so I dunno what\\'s up with that. I contacted HP about it, but they\\'ve never gotten back to me on it. I\\'ve found it to be a pretty minor annoyance though as if needs be I can still use my old laptop if I need to watch something at a louder volume. All in all, I\\'m pretty happy with this model, though I\\'ll update this review if anything new, good or bad, comes up with it. I decided to wait 3 months of using it before offering my opinion, and there you have it. ;) I can play gears 5 at 60fps on this laptop and some modern games like god of war and gears 5 and I like the graphics card and it also plays my games in vr too and I love it a lot it’s one of the best laptops in 2022 in my opinion if you’re looking for a cheap one and I like to play old games mostly on my computer like Gta 4 and aliens colonial marines and newer games like gods of war and gears 5 and Monster hunter rise Best laptop I\\'ve owned! Love the look of it with the green and black, beautiful at night in the dark with the keyboard lit green 👌. Its been perfect for me playing Lost Ark, no problems at all. Also I did the Used Like New option and the laptop is in perfect condition, not a single scratch. Battery life is decent when gaming it last a couple hours. 4.6 star rating is perfect. 👏👏 Let me start by saying it IS a laptop. I needed one to replace my aging laptop so that I could be up to speed since I am a college student, so it needed to have storage capabilities, speed, and be able to handle various processes with a decent battery. At moderate usage, the battery usually lasts about 5-7 hrs, having multiple tabs open, software compilers, etc. I strongly dislike MacAfee, so I uninstalled that right off the bat and use a different antivirus. This laptop is great for needing to be on the go since it is not large, and it also sports Wifi and ethernet ports, which can work in tandem with each other (connect to both at the same time). The RAM can also be upgraded, which I plan to upgrade the 4GB stick to an 8GB stick at some point. There\\'s no good time to buy a laptop so don\\'t waste too much time with comparisons, get the best you can afford and don\\'t look back to see that the price dropped the next day (it probably did). This one plays everything I\\'ve given it so far, at Ultra settings on 1920x1080 and that\\'s all I need. It was fairly easy to put extra RAM in there. The screen quality is fine for me. It runs a bit hot when it\\'s going flat out in a game but it hasn\\'t blown up yet. The combination of price and performance was a sweet spot for me on the day I bought it, and if the price has gone down since or there\\'s a better performer for the price I paid, I\\'m not going to stress out over it. The specs will tell you it\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s pretty darn good for the price and I have no reservations about having bought it at all. It looks smart and thin and just businesslike enough that it might not be stolen immediately you look the other way, unlike some gaming laptops. It\\'s a major league fingerprint magnet, if that worries you. I\\'m very happy with it. I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do. touch screen works perfectly. This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I\\'m very happy with it for the price. Wasn’t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability (thank god), when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen. Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that’s what I’ve been using it for. This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials. The computer operates great and has no issues. Great product! Excellent product & touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop. The size is great, it’s in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this. And Pink! light weight, easy to use I like the slim design of the HP Laptop.\\nIts very light, no extra battery to replace.\\nEasy to do work on, battery life is excellent so far.\\nScreen quality is great, sound quality is also very nice\\n\\nI love mine The laptop is light and very sleek. It doesn\\'t run slow. It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices. I play games sometimes and it doesn\\'t lag. FYI No this is not touch screen. The laptop came with the charger. I’ve had it for about two months. So far so good. I don’t use it for gaming or anything like that. Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media. This computer is sleek & modern looking. I only use it for chrome and Google drive documents (may need 2-4 open at a time). It loads sooooo painfully slow that I almost can’t do what I need to do. So you get what you paid for. But the color is cute. Very easy to use. Quite fast. Excellent for the money. Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos, play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work. Great laptop and a terrific price. I am very pleased with my laptop. Delivery was prompt, and the laptop was in excellent condition. It was very easy to set up. For the price it\\'s a great deal As functional as it is beautiful. It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds! A great buy! When the computer arrived I carefully took it out and tried to power it on it didn’t turn on so I placed it on the charger for 30mins to an hour and it still wouldn’t power on. After further investigating the issue I noticed that the light didn’t even come on whenever I had it plugged in charging. I thought maybe something happened to my outlet I had it plugged into so I tried four more different outlets throughout my house. Still no light came on indicating that it was getting power to it to charge. It had a sticker on the box as seen in one of the picture that I took that the computer had been tested for full functions and was ready for reuse! That’s a lie! I’m highly disappointed and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save yourself the time and trouble and avoid this product. exellent product good quality I love the touch screen the most! Lol but overall great investment! The computer works just fine, but I cant activate Windows 11 due to no windows product key. Love this computer. Work great! Love the color. I didn’t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised. Easy to start up walks you right through start up. Great price. I received this laptop in great condition, however it didn\\'t come with a charging cable. My only option was to return the entire thing/get a replacement or buy a cord separately. I didn\\'t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included, and I saw other customer photos that included it. I\\'m annoyed that I\\'ll have to pay for one separately, or go through the hassle or returning and recording it. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen. Turns out it was too good to be true. That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download, videos I watch, or updates I complete. They lied to most of us or they’re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color. Low cost. Works good. Would buy again. It\\'s great. Better than my old one. Great for the money spent. Haven’t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home, and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though. I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too. My laptop stopped working exactly 6 months after purchase.

I have Windows 11...which works great!! i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy. It’s a keeper for sure. Price can’t be bet. Bought this unit to replace a Lenovo that \"froze\" and would have cost $265 to fix. The battery lasts a lot longer than the Lenovo. I don\\'t use it for office/composing (the great American novel). I did add a cord-free mouse as I do NOT like a built in mouse, ever--a thin strip of card stock over the built-in mouse held in place with two rubber bands solves the \"touchy\" mouse problem. This unit does exactly what is stated that it will do--some people don\\'t read the description and are thus flumexed. Hello! Good purchase. Been using for awhile no problems with it. Works great was a good price This is my first Chromebook, and overall I’m quite pleased with the purchase. I’m mainly going to be using it for basic internet browsing and writing, so when I was shopping for the right model I was favoring cost, weight and battery life over other features like screen size and processing power. I ultimately felt this was the best balance of weight and battery life for the price. I definitely wasn’t wrong about the battery life. I’m amazed. This thing lasts and lasts. It’s not the fastest computer but it suffices for my use case.\\n\\nTwo things that bother me.\\n\\nThis first is the lack of an illuminated keyboard. I knew it lacked one going into it, so I can’t complain that much. I just didn’t realize how much I’ve come to rely on it on my other laptops. I’m often using the computer in dark environments, where it’s difficult to see the keys. Again, I knew this wasn’t an included feature, so this isn’t really a complaint as much as something to give extra consideration to before purchasing. With that being said, even with the lack of the illuminated keyboard, I don’t regret the purchase, and would buy again.\\n\\nWhich takes me to the second point. There is an issue with some of the video playback. In extra bright scenes in videos on YouTube and elsewhere, there is some discoloration in the highlights. Meaning, that in certain areas of the video, particularly that are white, there is some blue artifacts/pixelation happening. I have confirmed that this is an issue with this model and have seen it replicated in floor models at Best Buy and heard other people complain about this. I’m frustrated that HP has allowed this to continue to be a problem without offering a fix. As I said, most of my use cases involve writing; so video watching isn’t high up on my list of priorities. If it was, this would be a much bigger problem for me.\\n\\nOverall, I’m pleased with the purchase given the price, and recommend it for anybody who is looking for an inexpensive, long battery life Chromebook option. I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars. So far, this fits the bill pretty well, with a few minor differences from the Macbook. It was really easy to set up and import my passwords, bookmarks, etc. which was really convenient. Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to. I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included. I also miss having iTunes (now Apple Music), but I switched to Spotify. There are a few little things that are different that I\\'ve had to get used to, but nothing too major. I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone, because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen, not a touchscreen (tablet) or a little tiny screen (phone) All in all, it\\'s a great little laptop for the price. The PC works fine, but I do NOT like Windows 10/11. It keeps popping up when I\\'m trying to things and wants me to do \"this or that\". Stuff I do not need or want. I don\\'t use the touch screen, so can\\'t say anything about that. If I could put Win 7 on it, the laptop would be perfect. Good product based on its price so far excellent, the only thing is that I have not been able to porner the touch screen If you don\\'t mind looking at a small, iffy quality screen, then this Chromebook is fine for you. If you increase the letters on the screen too large, then it negatively effects your webpages and how many tabs you can have open.\\n\\nIt is fairly quick for it\\'s price point and allowed me to get schoolwork done when needed. I wouldn\\'t feel bad if I cracked the screen or broke it a few years from now since the price isn\\'t bad.\\n\\nIf these types of screens bother your eyes, I highly recommend IPS displays. You can get this same exact laptop but with an IPS display for only a few bucks more.\\n\\nAll in all, I decided to return it after my eyes were hurting from squinting at the screen. I went with a Lenovo Chromebook C330 11.6 inch ($180). Google operating system and apps are relatively new to me. But they seem useful. Not high power, but good for what I needed it for. Bill payments etc. Nice and compact. Rugged build. Screen not as bright as I would like. Good value. It\\'s easy to set up especially if you\\'re already connected to Google. I\\'m already excited about it for such a good price. It has a nice screen quality. I just pray it continues to work well. 🙏😉✌️ Update Below...First I should say that it\\'s not the Chromebook\\'s fault. It works fine as it was built. It\\'s not the machine\\'s fault that its model was built without a touch screen. I am a bit cranky with HP for making something of a big noise about their new 11a economy Chromebook with a touch screen... and then building a model of the 11a without one. If you go to the HP site and enter all twelve characters of the model number and ask for specs the specifications displayed won\\'t mention a touch screen because the 11a-na0010nr doesn\\'t have one. (The 11a-na0040nr does have a touch screen but the ...0010... does not.)\\nNone of this changes the fact that the product is misrepresented. The listing describes the machine as\\n\"...The powerful MediaTek mobile processor, full-size keyboard, and 11.6-inch touchscreen can handle it all. ... With an anti-glare, high-definition, 11.6-inch touch display, you can stream...\"\\nSo at two places in the \"About This Item\" text it promises a touch screen which the item does not have. Initially I thought about returning the machine but, on reflection, the lack of a touch screen is not a deal breaker. I decided that instead of returning the machine I would leave a one-star review instead.\\nUPDATE: Too many problems. Sending the Chromebook back. Problems that emerged since my previous review -- I can\\'t make the SD card reader work. I can activate the device in the device settings but most of the apps don\\'t see it. The settings for the individual apps don\\'t show the card in the External Storage Preferences. Notably, Netflix can\\'t see the card. You can\\'t download much video to watch offline if you can\\'t get to the SD card. Also, although the item was sold as new with a one year warranty, when I presented the serial number to the HP support page it informed me that the warranty was started in April of 2021 and expired this April just passes. So there is no warranty. Googling the support communities found only one thread discussing a similar problem (last month) but the only participant who resolved the problem did so by returning the machine. Starting to sound like the machine needs to go back. HP Chromebook didn’t work out of the box. There’s an error connecting to my WiFi network (even though it is, in fact, connected and works in guest mode). I never could get to the setup screens. Sent it away to HP to be fixed because it has a 30 day warranty. I’ll update my review whenever I’m able to use it.\\n\\nUpdate: I received the CB back from HP, and the same problem is still occurring. I spent about 45minutes with their online support to be told it needs to go back to HP to be fixed. If it isn’t fixed this time, I’m returning it. Each time I speak with someone they ask me about upgrading my warranty, which is even more frustrating. Why should I pay more money to purchase a warranty on a product that has never worked when I can return it for one that does?\\n\\nUpdate #2: After a month, my CB is working well. I really like it. Just wish it hadn’t taken a month to get it working. HP service was prompt and effective the second time around. Shipping took the most time. **Make sure you have a 90 day warranty.** Portable and lightweight, this Chromebook offers robust responsiveness and reliability. I’ve owned about 8 Chromebooks since they were introduced and this one ranks right up there near the tops in value and function. Perfect for carrying around and using near anywhere. Good product for the price. I strictly use it for school and it works great. Decent laptop for light use. Really hard to plug anything into USB port because its so tight. Decent battery life. This Chromebook is very similar to my past Chromebook so the transition was very easy. I needed to replace my old chromebook because it was outdated and about to lose its updates. Also it was big and cumbersome so I needed something smaller and lighter. I like the chromebook so when I found this one, it looked perfect for what I needed. It\\'s fast, has great screen quality and has google backup for six years. It is not a touchscreen. But it has a full sized keyboard and works well with a wireless mouse. I\\'m satisfied and I\\'m sure you will be too. Great for the price. My only complaint is the trackpad isn’t that good. My Apple ID was hacked, online banking had to be shut down, etc. I ordered this and was expecting it to be a \"learning curve\" but it was quick and simple to set up and just what I needed. A+!\\nPS: I entered my Google conditionals and poof! Everything was there! So far so good. Perfect size for me, perfect for on the go and school work! Not as easy as I expected. Ideal for studies. I purchased two of these items both of them had the same display problem which when I opened up a web page everything looked fine then when I went into it like let\\'s say Netflix it looked like x-ray people like high contrast was on and it wasn\\'t I opened up other web pages the same thing on two laptops, I got the same thing I don\\'t know if anybody else is experiencing this but I had to send them both back. After thinking why would 2 seperate laptops have the exact same problem, I figured it out, I had a contrast extension installed on my chrome web browser, and once i removed it both laptops were fine. So far thank you for a good purchase. Perfect for traveling. Wife loves the light weight and ease of use. Fast on and off too. You can’t use anything Microsoft. This one is not touch screen, but for the price, it’s perfect and I am able do use it for what I need. I like the way HP does keyboards and touch pads, and this product lives up to my expectations. ChromeOS has come a long way since I last looked at it 5 years or so ago. This notebook has the ability to run Debian Linux in a chroot environment that has display access for GUI applications, which is an enormous plus for me. The MediaTek - MT8183 SoC runs very quickly and no lags or apparent memory shortage even with lots of tabs open. The wifi radios are killer, great speed and range. If you are old like me it\\'s not great. But kids use it for school work. I used it as a backup in clinic when my computer froze and it worked perfectly. Just make sure u use your bifocals I love my laptop. My wife uses it more than I do. Lol It\\'s not a big laptop but it has been a really good one my kids have took right to it for school work. Ive used it we haven\\'t had one bad thing to say about it and the price was awesome. This is a glorified, oversized cell phone. Apps are okay but, I cannot print off this as there are no drivers for my printer. Also, limited on what you can do with any software and mouse pad. Save your money and just buy a laptop! The chromebook was great .....when I FINALLY got it .....it took 14 days to come !!!!!! Great little machine It works for my needs and is very user friendly. The seller was excellent. Very timely and arrived well before projected date. It\\'s small and compact. The screen display I thought would be clearer. The battery life is great. I can use it for almost 4 days before putting it to charge. I use these in my businesss. They are very affordable and does the job well. I use them for stock taking each year and have never had any problems with them. This year I purchased two new ones from Media Tek and 6 refurbished ones fromAmazon prime.\\nThe refurbished had no issues, but The brand new one was not charging . I was told that it would be replaced, however, the supplier recommended that I talk to HP support instead. Do not buy from Media Tek.\\nThese are great little chrome books , that are affordable . I love them. I don\\'t love this Supplier. Very good for myuse It\\'s a good laptop it\\'s got an excellent price but figuring out how to work Chromebook is a bit sometimes beyond me Its great for my 13 yr old. Great price for what u get. Would be nice to have a larger keyboard and scree option. However, this gets the job done for what I need at the time. Great buy!!! I bought this computer for schoolwork about a month ago ! and it works fabulous. Especially for the price 😀 I would definitely recommend Bought this for my son to use for the virtual school days and its almost perfect. We ran into a slight hiccup because there\\'s no windows button or caps lock key and he needs to know them for computer class. Otherwise its perfect for Google classroom. This is about the 7th or 8th Chromebook in the family and happy so far. Was looking for something something kids could abuse and also suitable for semi-rough treatment at the beach, camping, etc. Also wanted excellent battery life, which this has (non-touch screen version), typically 11 hrs plus at about 80% brightness. Is very snappy with new processor. Screen isn\\'t the highest quality but better than expected at this price. All-plastic build, but very sturdy, and more compact than earlier models due to smaller bezels. And it gets updates until June, 2028. If you need a basic laptop to perform basic functions this is perfect. Super compact and simple to use. The cost is fantastic. Perfect for my simple needs. Purchased this for my mother to replace her 10 year old HP laptop that was beginning to decline. She loves it and finds it very easy to use, especially being in her 60s and not very tech-savvy. Everything is very good except for the sound quality. It is very low especially when I have a fan on. I use a speaker or loud headphones with it. Good for its price though! it\\'s just plain good. dependable. This device is way to restrictive for what it allows you to see or install. If you do not give google full access to all your information and locations it will not allow you to install some apps. Heck, it will not even show me a lot of apps to install. The laptop ok, but google has just put in to many road blocks to really make it useful. It\\'s very important to note, this is a Chromebook NOT a full-sized laptop, so this may be much smaller than expected.\\nPersonally, I love this Chromebook, size and all. It works great and has a pretty decent quality. No issues with so far with charging, battery life, crashing, etc. I would only hope for a better sound quality, as it doesn\\'t get very loud at all. Plenty of storage space for me as well, as I use it for crafting (Design Space app, emails, saving photos, etc.) I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use. This is my home laptop. As I have a chrome book at work, I am used to using them and appreciate that they seem better protected from hackers than most laptops. If you want a fast, fairly lightweight laptop at a really low price, this is perfect. I use it for email, online shopping, bill pay, etc. It doesn\\'t have fancy bells and whistles but it\\'s exactly what I needed. Does much more than I thought it would. Will not accept some apps. The screen quality for me is bad, it would not and will not register certain colors and decides to make them either teal or blue. I can say the touch screen doesn\\'t work because while I didn\\'t know it was supposed to be toutch screen my family tried it and it never worked. Still the battery life is decently good. It can run most of the things I need, hut because of the problems listed above not as well as I would want/need. All in all with its problems it has and the few positives in comparison I give it two out of five stars. My older Chromebook was going to strip receiving updates last month so I needed to update my notebook. I couldn\\'t tell you how but while I was struggling with my printer and WiFi the Chromebook just magically downloaded everything from the old one too the new one. Like I said I don\\'t do \"tech\" the only thing is they were sitting on top of each other. 😁 I bought for 140$. It is a light, fast and great for laying in the bed 🙂. Very fast! I use this computer for my business everyday it is fast and the battery life is amazing Pleasantly surprised by how great the battery on this chromebook is. I got it on a Saturday, charged it to full battery then the next charge was a week after! Granted I don’t use it often (just to go online for a bit and watch Disney+) but still that’s a great battery life! Highly recommend just for that alone lol. Plus easy interface and controls. An overall great buy on a Prime day 😬👍🏼 Bought this to Homeschool my daughter and it works great. Easy to use and set up chromebook I didn\\'t realize how small it was however it\\'s a nice laptop,the screen did go black for a full day, it was charged an everything,for some weird reason it came back on, that\\'s the only issue I\\'ve had with it Awesome! Better than a laptop this chromebook is so fast and easy to use Work\\'s great, good picture! I bought this laptop after seeing that it has a Touchscreen but it does not . If anyone else wants a Touchscreen- stay away from this Laptop. Loved this compact computer until out of no where it just stopped working. Won’t turn on. Sits at a desk in my office, no trauma, was on and working, stepped away, then it was off and would not turn back on. Pulled in, not a battery issue. The display is small and makes focusing on media for any prolonged period a difficult task. The processor is quick and efficient and pages load quickly. The sleek design offers and easy store and carry. It’s a get the job done chromebook without many luxuries. The battery health is on point, there wasn\\'t anything that I disliked about it. The features are amazing. I owned this laptop for a month when it stopped working. After a few days of use, it started glitching and the screen would freeze multiple times a day. It would require needing to be restarted on a daily basis just so the laptop could become unfrozen. Assuming I may just had a bad computer, I reached out to the manufacture and they kindly offered to send a second laptop free of charge. The second laptop turned out to be worse than the first, however. After having that second laptop for less than a month it also stopped working. When looking at something with white in the web page, there would be what can best be described as blue scratch marks all over the screen. The company was nice, but I would not buy another chromebook from hp again. I previously owned a chromebook from Asus that cost half as much ($70 ish) but yet it lasted me 3 years. I wasn\\'t able to even get 1 month out of BOTH of my hp chromebooks.\\n\\nNow I bought the basic hp chromebook model without touchscreen. It is possible that the touchscreen version of this laptop avoids these issues. However, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Make sure you read the fine print. I received my chromebook. The package it was in was already opened. A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok. Plug it in to start using it and check it out. Kept saying it was charging. Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead. I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened. So I decided to get some support. Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did. After nothing worked, again. They told me to contact the seller, there was nothing else they could do to help me. I reached out to the seller and got no reply. And apparently I can’t return it. For any reason whatsoever. So now I have a cr*p laptop that I just wasted $ on that I guess I’ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it. So annoyed and disappointed. I haven’t even had it a few days and can’t even return for a replacement or to get my money back. Cool cool cool. Thanks took me awhile to figure it out but thanks to youtube , got it done..Very nice laptop This is perfect for what I need. I am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet, and it was just too small. This chromebook was perfect for my teens to do homework. The USB spot on the side of the Laptop kept scratching my mouse and Flash drives and they would get stuck in there to the point it felt like if you were to pull it out with minimal strength it would snap. I provided an image im not sure if you guys can see it very well but there are 2 lines that were made from scratching on my flash drive. Not only that but this laptop was completely useless to me. it was recommended to me by an Amazon agent after telling him what i was looking for so i thought they couldn\\'t possibly get it wrong but i was incorrect. you can\\'t even download anything on this laptop unless its from the play store, it was the equivalent to my Samsung phone everything you could do on this you can do on a phone except a phone is better allows you to download certain files like \".exe\" which Chrome Operating systems don\\'t. If your looking for a chromebook to use the internet only then its perfect i experienced no lag with it but if you want more than that keep looking. Beautiful Easy setup and operation, price was competitive and overall a good buy. Is perfect Got replica Chromebooks that my kids use at school. Work great. I liked everything about the product the packaging the product . Everything came included there was no missing parts no nothing . You so t waste ya time buying this Laptops worked great Came quick good quality This laptop is pretty nice works good it isn’t touch screen but works perfectly for what i need it for screen quality is okay but no issues Wow arrived earlier than expected. Such a nice small laptop. Already enjoying it.. Lightweight and sleek, great buy. Works great. I currently use it for college, and this is definitely an affordable option for those looking for a high quality laptop. At first I liked I expected it to be a little bigger but it was small easy to carry and go on to go the touch screen never worked but I was okay with that the real problems came on like the 8th day after having it for one it does not charge unless it\\'s all even when powered off it barely charged I\\'d have it on the charger for over 5 hours to get on there and only have 20% the keyboard layout constantly changes on you to as though you\\'ll have constant problems with your password and will end up having to use guest mode I do not suggest this product at all The only good thing about this computer was its size and weight. Other then that it\\'s better to just get an AO2s which is about the same price but runs more programs. It doesn\\'t play any games and what it does has a smaller selection then the store on my Samsung phone. You can\\'t even jail break it to run Linux without really complex coding. And even then it\\'s highly iffy. Overall just get a smart phone and skip this PC. Thank you! The Chromebook is exactly what I needed and the shipping was super fast. Would recommend this purchase This version doesn’t have a touch screen. Worked well right out of the box. Great battery life Perfect for watching movies, but wish the sound quality was better.\\nAlso great for work! Light, compact and battery lasts a long time! The keyboard is smaller than I prefer, but the functionality is perfect for my needs and budget. Does everything we need. Fast and efficient at a good price. Very happy with this purchase. Nice computer Fast Delivery, Great Laptop . Super Satisfied Nice, volume isn\\'t very loud but functions and speeds are sufficient.. No comment, but very useful. Love my laptop very fast connection and beautiful video quality. Very light and too cheap for me. I returned it\\nI have another chromebook but the quality of this is subpar. Love it thank you good quality for price love it This chromebook is not near the quality of my Acer chromebook. Popups are always coming up and the screen I\\'m viewing changes without any warning or reason. Also the screen is not nearly as sharply contrasting as the Acer. My advise is to not buy this piece of cheaply made junk. Not happy with this computer. Great price and arrived on time. However when I needed it to take my test to get my health and license license it was not compatible with their testing program. I missed my exam that day. Out of bucks. Have to retake it again and pay 60 more dollars. Highly frustrated. This was going to be my work computer but not anymore. Love spending forever trying to download a chromebook recovery onto an old usb drive because it wouldn\\'t boot at all. New out of the box and everything. And of course customer service just tells you to contact the manufacturer. In all fairness, after I had returned it, I realized that it had been a refurbished item. I didn\\'t know that. The return was easy. Want a honest review? Don’t bother ordering the specs are not true and unless you just plan on going online to look at videos on YouTube I wouldn’t waste your time. This is not even a good starter laptop. You can’t run any type of software off here better off using your phone to go on YouTube. The speed is slow and mine wouldn’t even hold a battery charge. Returned it Whenever you turn it on there is a loud noise coming out of it not sure why that is I guess it\\'s ready to fall apart ordered two of these and both of them had green blotches on the screen saver and certain youtube videos This product was a Christmas present for my son. He was so excited to get it.Then come to find out it turns on but you can\\'t see the screen. Total bummer. It will Be returning. Don\\'t buy.. WASTE OF MONEY Received this product used. Previous owner had to remove the personalized name stickers but did not do a good job. The HP logo has tons of scratches. The track pad has scuff marks and the screen has a deep scratch. I did not even bother turning it on. RETURNING IT Had this computer for 6 months. Loved it. Screen went black and never started up again. Tried all the troubleshooter options. Just never came back on. It worked great at first. Then it quit working after a short time. Trash laptop the sound is running But we are an epidemic or pandemic sometimes it\\'s handy to zoom with family and friends and I have been able to use it as a research tool As described. Quick delivery. I love this Hp Chromebook 11a it is great and it is adorable 🥰 I absolutely love it it is great for work and school and games love it Chrome os and The laptop arrived earlier that expected. I order it Sept 7 and it arrived at Sept 15. The item is also in good condition. I will order again. Thank you There have been some recent notifications for those that own earlier Chromebooks that updates will discontinue as well as the suspension of the Google Web Store. if you have an earlier model, you can still use it but without Chromebook updates to the OS.\\n\\nThankfully, HP and others have release newer models that utilize SD memory better (when used with the standard memory in the Chromebook). This particular model will share the 32gb SD card memory with the Google Play Store apps as well as allowing the user to dedicate memory specific to the Linux development environment.\\n\\nIf you had an earlier Chromebook (configured in development mode) and used Crouton with xfce, you may have been disappointed with some of the quirks of the Linux desktop if you needed it for applications that weren\\'t available from Google (for your Chromebook) such as RealVNC for remote desktop applications. Thankfully, the model allow for more memory for the Linux applications. If you do choose to install the KDE desktop (I couldn\\'t get Crouton to work) make sure you allocate 10gb (rather than the suggested amount) since the KDE desktop loads up several apps you may not need including LibreOffice.\\n\\nThe KDE desktop is very flakey to use but this Chromebook has a separate section for Linux apps that can be executed without loading KDE first (without the need for learning a new GUI) since this model utilizes virtual memory better between the two operating systems.\\n\\nWhen installing RealVNC, this app has to be installed through KDE (using the .def file) through the terminal window. Once executed through KDE, the shortcut link to app resides in a the Linux app folder so that the separate Linux GUI no longer has to be executed first. It took me several hours to figure out the features but it is more reliable for hybrid work environments than the earlier generations used.\\n\\nIf you use Office, One Drive. or Nextcloud, these apps can be installed through the Google Play Store so that you can use them from your Chromebook as the app, rather than through the Chrome web browser (if you choose to do so).\\n\\nIf your phone doesn\\'t have enough room for gaming apps, no worries. Many of the gaming apps can be downloaded from Google Play and execute from the Chromebook.\\n\\nThe battery life does last for 15 hours and has better execution and performance than earlier models.\\n\\nLike most Chromebooks, it is lightweight and doesn\\'t need a great deal of cables plugged into it. It does work with Chromecast and is available as an option if the Chromebook sees any on the same network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis model works with OpenVPN too without file conversion by downloading the app from the Google Play Store and using the nonwindows config files to operate.\\n\\nI recommend using the USB 3.0, 1GB ethernet adapter from UGreen if you want to be a wired network. Those who live in tech areas like Seattle, the Bay Area, or the the Willamette Valley should know that the best security is wired internet to prevent any snooping over wi-fi.\\n\\nThere is no touchscreen on this model. Another thing about this computer is you can download hundreds of Apps. There is an App for EVERYTHING!!\\nAlso the port for the mouse was a little bit tight so I had to use a bit of pressure to plug it in but it works just fine. This computer meets all my needs. I can do everything on it that I did on my laptop. The screen is great. I can use my mouse and my printer. I don\\'t play games on it. I can do word processing and spread sheets. It is very fast! It starts up in seconds and web pages load in seconds. I have no complaints! I got this Chromebook specifically for learning Spanish while traveling or while at work. It is durable and battery life is great. The size is great for travel and does everything I need for what Im using it for. Sound quality is good too. If you need to plug headphones in you can. My one beef with this laptop is the screen quality. More expesnive laptop 400+ tend to have a nice white screen with brightness. These chromebooks tend be made of cheaper material and have that horrid blue tint to them. Not a fan. For the price, it\\'s an exceptional computer. I enjoy the simplicity of it being a chromebook. I\\'m a writer and don\\'t require much. It provides me everything I need. The battery lasts quite awhile, the screen is great quality, and it\\'s perfect size/weight. Omg! Better than I thought. It is just right for me. It came before time and it works great must buy... Love this Chromebook. Easy to use, lightweight, and easily portable. Bought this to replace an old laptop. Since I\\'m retired, I didn\\'t need a lot of bells and whistles. This does everything I need it to do. Just be sure to check the compatibility list for printers on the HP Smart app before buying a new printer. Do not depend on the printer descriptions. I made that mistake. Nice little laptop for the price , I\\'m not very tech savvy but it works great for my streaming and stream labs , as well at twitch and Netflix etc.\\n\\nA small hiccup in shipping but contacted the seller at 3am and they got back to me at 5am??? Handled everything and we\\'re super professional and nice. Talk about costumer service\\n\\nCouldn\\'t be happier I really can\\'t accurately rate this item - it was a gift delivered to my son in another state. What I can say it arrived quickly (next day) and son says it works good. Hard to beat. Most quality computer for the money. Would buy again. The best price on the market I love the waY it works and I love the way it do Bought this for my son\\'s 11th bday. So far, he loves it! Very good 👍👍👍 I love it will b back I like how easy it is to use Perfect super great wrapped very good package and excellent my Baby boy loved his Christmas gift This is a great device. We love it. Best purchase ! Affordable, easy access, screen quality Super for the use that is required. high school HP 11 inch Chromebook is fast with quick bootup and is to easy to navigate with smooth touchpad. Setting adjustments tune Chromebook to your liking and with app store at a touch of an icon..many add on apps are available. 2 rear speakers give plenty of sound and wifi connection has not so far had any drop outs or lagging. Chromebook was given as Christmas gift but stayed in house hold so will see how performance is going foreward. I bought this for my daughter due to the pandemic she had to use it for virtual school and it is amazing for price I will definitely purchase again for my other kids . Perfect for our kids when doing sch The Graphics are beautiful!! Would recommend. It is a good option for basic and simple tasks as well as for social networks, very practical to take anywhere It is perfect for doing school work. The battery lasts for approximately 10 to 11 hours. As for the size, I don\\'t think it\\'s small but I don\\'t think it\\'s big either, it\\'s very comfortable to use and perfect for doing work in word processors. Excellent for non-design, architecture or engineering students.\\n\\ncomplies to be able to study Nice device.\\nBut beware!\\nOnly an American power connection for the socket is included and the keyboard is American, i.e. qwerty and not like the German qwertz.\\nThe device is therefore not so practical for children who need the device to learn. A very good device. I didn\\'t like the American power supply cable! Luckily I had a German ready. 🙂 works really well fast delivery arrived in excellent condition thank you Very good laptop, it works 100% and looks and feels quality. I arrive before the estimated date, perfectly packaged, it is practical, just what my daughter needed for her classes I\\'m a writer and student and use non-MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook. I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling. I have a large desktop \"work\" computer where most of my work is done. I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop. Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last, but these laptops, on average last abut 2-3 years. Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad.\\n\\nAbout the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had 4G of RAM and the other had 8G of RAM. This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video. The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the \"Windows 10-S.\" It is easy to get out of, and there is a toggle to change the program to \"Windows 11 Home,\" which is more capable of evading corporate MS\\'s iron handed ownership of my computer. The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions. It is just a matter of going into \"settings\" and changing it.\\n\\nI do not mind the PC and MS \"marriage\" but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook. This one is constantly asking (begging) me to turn on my Cloud service, and turn on other MS Programs. I do not do any of that, and I do not want to send my work to the cloud (When I import it into the big machine I will). I like that it has an extra USB port. Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook, (which I like but cannot use because of the non-MS proprietary writing programs I use).\\n\\nAs far as using it for entertainment or videos, the sound is nice and loud (but not blasting) the picture is great, and it does not buffer endlessly-- but that may be my internet service.\\nMy overall opinion is \"nice.\" It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend $1000 on top of the line equipment. Nope. this is just a \"tuck it in the bag and go\" type computer. This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost. It’s a beautiful color and it has a clean look. My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it’s great for the price. This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose, and homework. The vaule is good for the money spent. The one we got is not touch screen. We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it, but I restart it and then have no problems after that. It is also good speed computer. We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well. Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn’t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems I needed a PC just for internet browsing, email and the like.\\nFor just over $200 delivered, this PC fills the bill.\\nIt may be a refurb but mine looks like new - not a scratch or ding anywhere.\\nThere\\'s a camera, but no touchscreen.\\nThere\\'s Windows 11; it took about an hour to update the year-old build.\\nIt\\'s fast enough for my purposes.\\nAnd it looks good, too, not nearly as pink as in the pictures. I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do. touch screen works perfectly. This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I\\'m very happy with it for the price. Wasn’t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability (thank god), when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen. Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that’s what I’ve been using it for. This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials. The computer operates great and has no issues. Great product! Excellent product & touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop. The size is great, it’s in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this. And Pink! light weight, easy to use I like the slim design of the HP Laptop.\\nIts very light, no extra battery to replace.\\nEasy to do work on, battery life is excellent so far.\\nScreen quality is great, sound quality is also very nice\\n\\nI love mine The laptop is light and very sleek. It doesn\\'t run slow. It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices. I play games sometimes and it doesn\\'t lag. FYI No this is not touch screen. The laptop came with the charger. I’ve had it for about two months. So far so good. I don’t use it for gaming or anything like that. Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media. This computer is sleek & modern looking. I only use it for chrome and Google drive documents (may need 2-4 open at a time). It loads sooooo painfully slow that I almost can’t do what I need to do. So you get what you paid for. But the color is cute. Very easy to use. Quite fast. Excellent for the money. Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos, play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work. Great laptop and a terrific price. I am very pleased with my laptop. Delivery was prompt, and the laptop was in excellent condition. It was very easy to set up. For the price it\\'s a great deal As functional as it is beautiful. It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds! A great buy! When the computer arrived I carefully took it out and tried to power it on it didn’t turn on so I placed it on the charger for 30mins to an hour and it still wouldn’t power on. After further investigating the issue I noticed that the light didn’t even come on whenever I had it plugged in charging. I thought maybe something happened to my outlet I had it plugged into so I tried four more different outlets throughout my house. Still no light came on indicating that it was getting power to it to charge. It had a sticker on the box as seen in one of the picture that I took that the computer had been tested for full functions and was ready for reuse! That’s a lie! I’m highly disappointed and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save yourself the time and trouble and avoid this product. exellent product good quality I love the touch screen the most! Lol but overall great investment! The computer works just fine, but I cant activate Windows 11 due to no windows product key. Love this computer. Work great! Love the color. I didn’t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised. Easy to start up walks you right through start up. Great price. I received this laptop in great condition, however it didn\\'t come with a charging cable. My only option was to return the entire thing/get a replacement or buy a cord separately. I didn\\'t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included, and I saw other customer photos that included it. I\\'m annoyed that I\\'ll have to pay for one separately, or go through the hassle or returning and recording it. I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen. Turns out it was too good to be true. That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download, videos I watch, or updates I complete. They lied to most of us or they’re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color. Low cost. Works good. Would buy again. It\\'s great. Better than my old one. Great for the money spent. Haven’t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home, and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though. I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too. My laptop stopped working exactly 6 months after purchase. Never will purchase another refurbished pc. First and last. Avoid refurbished. Nothing is able to be saved on this computer. I\\'m returning it.\\nRecommend DI NOT BUY. I love the color the screen looks excellent but it is too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished.\\nVery upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already.\\n\\nWhile I was working, it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere ( see pics)\\nIt happened multiple times!\\nThis last time the screen wouldn\\'t come back, and I had to turn off and turn on again.\\n\\nNot reliable. I had it for a week only. I will be returning this.\\nI spent extra $100 and got a brand new one….\\n\\nToo risky! At first it was taking forever (3mins and a blank screen) to log in. I was ready to take it back. Then I tried to update and restart, then it started up right away. Hopefully this can handle my daughter\\'s first year of college! So far, not bad for price. The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor. Arrived like new. Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work , was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid. It is a great little laptop. I love finding these great buys in the refurbished/renewed shop Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great product.\\nThanks This is not a touch screen computer. It doesn’t say it in the description. The comments made me think so. It came in perfect condition basically brand new. A little slow but very worth it! I’ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it’s literally a steel I love it. It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer! Easy set up and love the color Great purchase. Was a little scared at first to get but I’m happy I did. To replace a later hp laptop. Needed something smaller. More for ME!! I\\'m very satisfied. Not a single scratch or issue. Beautiful color also. 😍 This product came in impeccable condition! I was a tad bit surprised that the color popped so nicely. The system runs very well. I am very impressed with this lightweight laptop as I travel a great deal for business. Great computer. 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, extra storage slot. Battery lasts a very long time. I have Windows 11...which works great!! i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy. It’s a keeper for sure. Price can’t be bet. Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill. It came with Windows 11 which seemed to work well. Had no trouble with setup. It is lightweight and for a refurbished item. it looked brand new. My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming. It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine. It does not come with a CD/DVD player. I use flash drives to transfer data and programs. A 5 star buy. I needed a new laptop computer just for general use and this one from Amazon seemed like it would do the job. So far I\\'ve been very pleased with the machine. I\\'ve been using it for web browsing using Chrome and some general light computing work and it has worked great.\\n\\nI like the screen a lot. Text is clear and easy to read and 1920x1080 resolution is plenty for a screen of this size. It has been bright enough to use outside when I was working on setting up some networking equipment for a friend.\\n\\nThe keyboard and track pad both feel nice and work well. I wish the little bumps that identify the home row keys were a little bit larger but overall it is pretty good.\\n\\nI have another 8GB of ram ordered so that I can have 16GB by just adding another card.\\nYesterday I upgraded the memory to 16GB using a Crucial CT8G4SFRA32A. This plugged right in but in order to install the extra stick of memory I had to remove the back from the computer. I had to take out about 8 screws and then carefully pry off the back using a plastic spudger. All done with no problems but access could be easier.\\n\\nThis is my first machine with the Windows 11 operating system. Out of the box and in day to day use it has been very good. Adding my printers, applications and other stuff has been painless, sleep, waking up and overall power management has all worked well.\\n\\nThe computer didn\\'t come with a huge amount of crapware to remove either. There were a few things like some McCafee stuff but nothing excessive.\\n\\nI have not pushed the battery life all that much but so far it has been very adequate for my needs.\\n\\nI\\'ve liked the machine well enough to order another one for a family member who needs a new Windows PC.\\n\\nSo far so good after a couple of weeks and well worth the money. If you can afford $400, go for this one. I’ve tried getting cheaper computers on Amazon. One was $150 which didn’t work and I it had to be returned. The second was $250 and that didn’t work and had to be returned.\\nI found when I’ve set those computers up that both of them had that software last loaded early in 2021. This HP computer had a software loaded in a few months prior to the time that I bought it. So it’s windows is up-to-date. It’s other software is up-to-date. The microphone and the screen works perfectly.\\nIf you need a new computer and your uses are simple and you just need it to reliably work., Get this HP. It’s perfect. It’s fine. It Works. I did not need Customer Support to remote in and remove software and then reload it.\\nI zoom four hours a day and boots up and goes.\\n\\nIt was great out of the box. This doesn\\'t have touch screen on my model. The FHD display really surprised me. It\\'s better picture than a lot of these TVs. As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. As soon as the 33th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it\\'s got a burnt pixel. No way to fix that without replacing the screen. Unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. HP is still shady in that regard. I fully upgraded the machine when I got it. 16GB ram, 1TB Samsung 980 SSD. The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. I have a Geforce 980, an octocore AMD CPU, and 24GB DDR3 ram in my tower. This laptop of course has a little less RAM, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. I really am surprised at this. The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 CM gap. There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just isn\\'t room. They couldn\\'t even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. I had problems with HP in the past, they screwed up a laptop return I sent in, then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures, so I\\'m not shocked at how they treat customers. I swore I\\'d not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up. It\\'s super light weight. The camera is nothing fancy, in Windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. It\\'s instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool. Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. You\\'ll also want to get a good set of headphones. The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out. The machine simply wasn\\'t designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. When you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you\\'ll find it\\'s incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI. It forces you to keep the screen open, which isn\\'t good to have static screens. I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there isn\\'t anything I can do about it. It isn\\'t that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. I have a warranty but again, it\\'s not going to cover this damage, so I spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen. The case is the cheapest plastic they could find. Given this was produced during the pandemic you\\'re left with another problem. Check your RAM speeds. If you get stuck with a 1R16 chip you\\'re basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2R8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. They don\\'t mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you\\'ll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. Overall, I probably wouldn\\'t buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. It\\'s just too poorly designed. I give it a year or two before it fails. Most likely, knowing HP it will be 26 minutes after the OEM warranty expires. They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it\\'s been nearly 8 years since I swore I wouldn\\'t buy another one, they changed; for the worse. Ok so overall this laptop is a decent, practical, all-around laptop. Not great, but good enough. If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better.\\n\\nIf you’re like me, don’t have time to scout the internet, and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation, then it’s possible at some point you’re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you’ll accept only being reasonably happy with it (aka I settled).\\n\\nHere is my observation of each aspect of the laptop:\\n* The screen quality is good, but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough, so I’m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment.\\n\\n* The battery life is ok, lasting me about 7 hours currently. We will see how long that keeps up, as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about 1-2 years.\\n\\n* The keys feel good to type on, which I was relieved to find.\\n\\n* The speed of the laptop is only alright. For an SSD, I expected it to be faster. This machine will stream video just fine, but don’t plan on doing any video editing or gaming.\\n\\n* The weight is actually very nice, but that should be expected with such a small screen.\\n\\n* One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot, which I like. Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan, but this computer does not need that. I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm.\\n\\n* Lastly, and unfortunately, the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable. At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings. But after doing so, I realized it is not a software issue.\\n\\nThe problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough. So in effect, what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad. That is fine when you’re moving the cursor large distances across the screen, but it means that fine, small movements are difficult to achieve. It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this.\\n\\nLuckily, I came up with a solution. You will need to order a touchpad cover / skin for $10. They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones. It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface. This worked well. The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop, so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size.\\n\\nHere are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks:\\n\\nFix screen settings:\\nright click on the desktop > show more options > AMD radeon software > display > reduce contrast to 94 > increase the brightness to 25\\n\\nFix touchpad by searching for this on amazon:\\n\\nCaseBuy MacBook Air 13 Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skin\\n\\ncut it down to size and install it\\n\\n(make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don’t have any bubbles in it after you’re done)\\n\\nAfter you’re done installing it, you’ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity.\\n\\nGo to:\\nWindows settings > bluetooth & devices > touchpad > taps > touchpad sensitivity > high sensitivity\\n\\nThat’s all I’ve got. Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it. Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them. So this was the first non high-end gaming laptop I\\'ve ever purchased, with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school, work, and general basic use. To be quite honest, it\\'s surprisingly nice! After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a 15\" display from my previous 17\", the screen is of good quality. The processing speed is not disappointing at all. The sound is great (it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that). I don\\'t find Windows 11 to be offensive to use. Keyboard is friendly. It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality (not super cheap feeling). It\\'s light to carry. Loads videos and webpages quickly. No crashing or general use issues as of yet. I\\'ve even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it\\'s running just fine. I\\'m really pleasantly surprised. And coming from someone who is used to a 5k+ Alienware Gaming Laptop (aka me), the fact that I don\\'t hate this thing is truly impressive enough. If you pressed me to find something I don\\'t love about it, I\\'d say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh. It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying. But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work, I plugged it in and hit the power button, only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it. So I am not even mad. No touch screen on my model. And I can\\'t attest to it\\'s gaming abilities because, well, I have an Alienware for that. Seriously though, best spent $400 ever. I like how lightweight it is, the ram is upgradeable & so is the SSD drive! I have always been partial to HP; my last 4 computers have been HP\\'s. I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too. It drains the battery faster than I would like, but it could be my settings, I will keep you all posted. Thank you, Amazon!!!\\nAdditional Findings! A month in and this is what I discovered: When I ordered this laptop, I had two things in mind. # One is a backup computer for my desktop, I use it for my entertainment system, it is partly a backup Plex Server. It works great by the way. # Two I wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to a coffee shop and do whatever, as I enjoy my coffee outdoors. No complaints so far. I have since tweaked my battery settings and have literally increased my battery life by about 3 times between recharges. Go to YouTube and look up how to extend battery life on an HP Laptop and you will find helpful tips. I have no heat problem what so ever (some people have complained about that.) I upgraded the memory to 16 gigs and it is fast as all get out. So, hence my rating stays a 5 star! Keep in mind it is made of plastic, be gentle, if you wish to upgrade on your own, don\\'t be a bull in a China shop. Yes, before you ask, you can hook it up to a large monitor and close the lid, it is in Windows settings, when in doubt YouTube is my go-to. I hope this helps I am happy to answer questions, if I can. Understand what you are buying and how you want to use the product and have fun! Great laptop If it seems good to me so far there is no volume just on the speakers jj This laptop did surprise me. The Ryzen 5 mobile CPU is rather good and the 8GB of RAM that it comes with is more than sufficient if you only plan on doing simple tasks - office work, watching videos on video websites, etc.\\n\\nI was surprised to see next to no bloatware on my machine, though this could be due to the fact they do only give you a 256GB SSD. There is an expansion slot for a SD/Micro SD card, but the laptop does have an additional slot for another stick of RAM and you can swap out the included SSD with an upgraded one, provided you know how to do it or know someone that can do it.\\n\\nIf you upgrade to 16GB of RAM for dual channel mode and get a high performant SSD, then you get a lot more performance since Ryzen processors often work better with dual channel memory. This is essential if you want to do any medium gaming on this laptop. I upgraded mine and I love it even more. GOOD QUALITY 1. Amazing battery life\\n2. Fast Ryzen processor\\n3. Comes with 8gb ram but I added one more 8gb for 27$. Runs butter smooth\\n4. Best value at this price point this is a good cheap laptop for doing various activities, however gaming is a very poor experience on this laptop. i dont know why it is marketed for gaming, as it can barely hit 30 frames at 1080 on most games. i assume you could run some very light indie games or super well optimised games on it, but anything that requires any kind of gpu power, forget about it. i will still give 5 stars tho because it does everything i need it to and does it well. good battery life i usually get at least 5 hours of use out of it per charge. I’m very happy with this laptop, I’ve had it like 2 weeks now and I’ve used it every single day. It arrived very quickly. It’s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs, homework, web browsing, to even some gaming. I’ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested, but even just with the 8gb I’ve been able to run some lower spec games. Games like Sims 3/4/city, Bethesda games, age of empires, ALMOST everything I’ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles. Whether you’re looking for a cheaper option for playing games (don’t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings), a school laptop, or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on, this is a good contender for the price. The only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars are; the external hardware is nothing fancy, not bad quality just could be better, the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast, and the material the track pad is made of is not that great. Other than that, I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop.\\n\\nEDIT: I have had it for like 4 months now. I still love it and all of this still remains true. I have played some better games on it as well, such as Ready or Not and Arma 3. Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions. Arma 3 runs like a charm 85% of the time. In single player you van even run on ultra graphics for an FPS trade off. I run the CPU pretty hard sometimes and it does pretty well at keeping up. Needed a new laptop and this was just what I needed. Easy to set up and it loads quickly. I bought this for my Nephew. He likes it a lot, but he is a writer and he had to install and pay for a word program. I don\\'t know why laptops don\\'t offer something simple for writing purposes. Other than that, he is pleased with the laptop. This computer seems to work fine. I thought from the photos it had an SD card reader, but it just has a slot for one so I have to use a separate card reader. Excellent performance for daily tasks, banks, online procedures, downloading and editing files, etc. Great contribution of bluetooth connectivity, excellent wifi speed. Very fast in everything. Great price for this purchase. Satisfied customer Excellent team! Virtually everything they offer, however, does not have the Backlit keyboard as it says in the characteristics for sale. (They should take care of that detail), for the rest, it is very fast, I love the screen, excellent quality and the battery has a great duration This is a great computer for the value and I am happy with the purchase but, when the computer arrived, it was missing the 3 prong connector jack for the plug to outlet. Please take note as I had to wait another two days and purchase this part. If you plan on using this outside it may not be bright enough. Bought this laptop specifically for school. It’s great and not so big that it doesn’t fit on my desk that holds my work stuff. The screen brought a detail. A light point that is noticeable when the background is dark. The battery does not last more than four hours and it has a problem that, I think is a configuration problem, that does not let me place the accent. I make the adjustments in language, I restart it and everything is fine. After two minutes, it comes back with the same problem. I feel disappointed. I don\\'t know how to request a change, because I bought it from Venezuela. I bought this for general use, as well as photo editing. I know there are more robust laptops and PC’s out there, but I didn’t want to spend a ton. This laptop is very good for the price. It starts up quickly and handles apps with no problems. I do not play games on it, so I cannot tell you how it runs those. I do have Lightroom and Photoshop on it and it handled those very well out of the box. I did, however, add 8GB of RAM to the laptop and Lightroom and Photoshop do REALLY well now. No issues whatsoever. I didn’t know how I’d feel about the Ryzen processor, but it does a fabulous job. With the added memory, I don’t think there’s anything this laptop won’t handle.\\n\\n*Note. If you are going to add RAM to this laptop, BEWARE. You have to remove the entire bottom panel including removing the glued on grip pads. When you remove these, they may or may not come off cleanly, meaning they may not go back on the way they were without some glue or repair. Just be extremely careful in removing them. This may be the best option available for less than $500 as of February 2022. It has decent battery life (7-8 hours), good performance, it’s portable, and upgradable (if you are skilled & careful). Perfect for a student or for business use. You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse, office work, watch movies, etc. Be prepared to deal with Windows 11 (sigh) and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU’s and Windows brilliant fan control… Overall, I recommend it. I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads. However, I am familiar with upgrading and repairs. This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding. I’m happy thus far! My only gripe is the screen. The refresh rate is noticeably low with media viewing (Netflix). The AMD Ryzen 5 chip gives this laptop great performance and battery life. Both the CPU and especially the built-in GPU perform very well. Also, it really doesn\\'t get hot nor draw much battery during operation. A very good performing inexpensive laptop overall. For what it is, it\\'s pretty good, a ryzen 5 with an SSD and a fhd screen for 400 is honestly impressive. I hate the fact that windows 11 was installed by default, so I moved to Fedora Linux as soon as I was to. I haven\\'t tried any gaming, but I can confidently say it won\\'t run much. Definitely a better choice than a chromebook. I loved everything about this laptop. It was great until I went to turn it on the other day and though the light indicating it was starting up went on, it quickly went off and it has not worked since. Since it is a laptop, I was advised it would be cheaper to buy a new one rather than fix this one. Very disappointed! I never really take my laptop anywhere so I never really rely on it for on the go, I’ve bought this so I can run emulators on my laptop and the limit of this pc seems to be The ps3 emulator, so everything before it should run fine. That’s for people that care about that but overall a solid Investment for me I bought this for my granddaughter who is a Sophomore in high school because she is taking computer graphics courses. She really likes it. We needed a computer that was light and portable for school. This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for, and we bought it and a additional stick of ram. It works well, performance is plenty.\\n\\nBut the. Negative, and why it doesn\\'t get. 5 stars. The feet are small starving it for air, even when raising it, the fan loves to spin up, way too loud and waay to often. A laptop cooler rectified this issue but for a low power laptop, not impressed with the cooling. Screens OK, nothing special, which that\\'s this laptop top to bottom, OK, nothing special. I\\'d definitely but another, but I might pull apart and check the thermal compound, put some higher quality compound on it, and see if it helps. It\\'s a basic laptop that you can use for work. Comes with Windows 11 and you then buy Office. It\\'s really lightweight - almost exactly as light as the MacBook Air. So if you don\\'t want to spend a lot on a laptop and you only use it for basic stuff like Office, YouTube and web surfing and you are not too finicky about specs then it\\'s a great choice. The AMD Ryzen is pretty fast - kinda faster than Intel IMO. HP has a home run with the average, non gaming user. Just wanted a quick boot up and won’t burn my legs laptop at a reasonable price. Rips through all my programs with ease. I am very satisfied. I bought this laptop for my kids so they could do homework and it works really good. No issues so far. Pretty quick Exactly what I expected. Perfect size and power for what I need. Good looking unit too. Seller was very accommodating too. Good specs for this mid-level laptop. Perfect for my kid heading off to college. It has all that is needed except maybe an additional upgrade in RAM needed in the next year or two. I wish the keys lit up. The whole keyboard seems rickety and not very sturdy. It will do for now but I regret not buying another MacBook. My son wanted a gaming laptop for his birthday. He enjoys Minecraft, Roblox, and some Steam games. I didn’t want to invest in a laptop built specifically for gaming quite yet, but this had specs that I felt would work for his interests. I also followed a reviewer’s advice and instructions (by the way, that review deserves a gold medal) to acquire and install another stick of RAM to bring it up to 16g. Not gonna lie, I narrowly avoided a heart attack while removing the bottom plate of the laptop, but it really was a pretty easy process to give an upgrade that lets my son play the heavier Steam games without lag. He is very happy, and so is my wallet! Its good for basic gaming but anything like vr or final fantasy will not be playable unless you take out the entire motherboard and get a new one so you might as well get a better more expensive laptop because thats gonna cost about the same Add another compatible 8GB 3200 RAM (about $40) and upgrade to a fast 1TB-2TB NVMe SSD ($60-$200). I play Fallout4 with a mix of med to mostly high settings with no lag. I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows 11 as my desktop could not be upgraded. So far for the budget price it was a good choice, so I\\'m not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel. It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows 11. My opinion on Win 11 is still out. I gifted this for my daughter who is a gamer and builder. I wanted to give this Laptop 5 starts but the battery life is no good. In just 20 mins I lose 10% battery power even when it runs on balanced. Overall a great and powerful little computer. Lightweight and excellent screen quality. Do I recommend buying? Yes. My grand son picked it out. As suits well for UTC I do shirt design and am a college student so I definitely use my computer a lot, this computer functions well and is pretty fast. The battery last me maybe 6 hours and is very lightweight. It\\'s not touch screen but other then that decent and fast Best priced laptop. AMAZING battery life and quick charge. You get everything you want in a simple but powerful computer without having to pay for the \"premium\" of a top brand name, or the \"premium\" of an Intel Chip. Thing works just fine -- one glitch is I have to often restart my laptop (takes like 30 seconds max) to initially connect to my WiFi ... maybe an easy fix?\\n\\nI\\'d recommend this laptop - I just want to know how to fix the reboot issue. Highly recommend! My son has been begging for a laptop for gaming and has a bday coming up (big 12). This laptop has good specs and we upgraded the ram to 16gb (up to 32gb). The hard drive can be upgraded (up to 2tb). The price is budget friendly. This laptop runs steam and GTA 5 without issues. Pro: quick, seems well built for the price, value for money\\n\\nCons: no fingerprint reader (I assume the IR camera replaces this, but not my liking), dim screen, need to add extra stick of 8GB RAM to get all the performance off the CPU Speedy and powerful, I can finally play Genshin Impact. Great battery life and fast to update with a lot of storage. The internet reception isn\\'t very good on it though. The equipment arrived in good condition and performs 100% i had this laptop for few months.\\nlet me tell you. this laptop is the best bang for the buck. when i first got it, it had everything i needed in a laptop. I got it for the main purpose to use it on the go when i am not at the office.\\nhowever, after few months, i started noticing that every time i turned it on, the battery is dead. which makes the laptop unusable, especially for the purpose i got it for.\\nthis week, i made sure to charge it to 100% and turned it off, so it is ready to be used when i needed it in case of emergency.\\nto my surprise, when i turned it on after few days, the battery was at 0% completely drained, while the laptop was off. Good value for money, works as described. Good fast delivery. The only problem I have is that the processing is not as good with windows 11, the rest of the PC is fine it\\'s light it\\'s ryzen 5. I do realize that I needed a graphic card though I got this for school as an online college student and I love it!... So far. I\\'ve only had it a few days but it works great! It runs fast, I love that the keys are big and don\\'t on them. It\\'s lightweight and the screen is a good size. All and all I\\'m very pleased. The idle cpu was quite high when I first got it. Still is even after some tweaking. perfect screen and my games work fine Produst was as expected but I ordered 2 laptops and only one came with shipment. Had to find out why and apparently warehouse only had one but there was no communication so 1 daughter happy and other disappointed as we had to order a different one from another seller.\\nRefund was quick though. I am very pleased with this laptop, overall. I opted for the Windows 11 version and find it to be what I wanted in this type of computer.\\n\\nI find the lack in number of USB ports to be a downer, but a quality USB hub (I use UGREEN products) will fix that shortfall. I am adding additional memory to the unit, my folly ...\\n\\nRecommend! Really good specs for a laptop. I did purchase another stick of 8 gb ram, not too bad to install, just be patient when removing bottom panel. Cinebench score of 5299, which for a mobile processor is not bad. Plan on using with an external monitor, external keyboard, external mouse for CPA/business/tax work. Cheaper than buying a small form factor desktop. Bought this to replace my last HP laptop that died. So far, I\\'m impressed. Bought this for simple audio recording and it is amazing for that. It is very snappy out of the box, but I did upgrade it with another 8 gig stick of ram for future proofing. I would wholly suggest it for any type of workstation duties. I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer. My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen. I\\'d be lying if I said I don\\'t miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake, I thought it was a touchscreen, it is not. It\\'s a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for. So far so good. So far I have had no problems. The speed is good. I have a second memory card that I haven\\'t installed yet, but will soon. As fast as it is now, I can only imagine how much better it will be. Will give another update later. Excellent quality price. Everything came fine, box was sealed and undamaged but when it was opened I notice this huge scratches at the back. Somewhat displeased because I know this is a new system but now it feels like a used device Thanks Very sleek and light weight. Love it This laptop is really good and fast. I just upgraded the ram 8gb to 16gb crucial ram and also 1tb sss crucial. Now this thing is butter. Good to buy I had doubts about the AMD processor, used to Intel for a long time but it is super fast, the battery lasts many hours. It is not tactile but the colors of the screen are great. Comes with Windows 11 Touch screen nice Just the right stuff for home and student. I tried to like this laptop, I love how lightweight it is and the screen is pretty good, it gets bright enough. The CPU is also very fast for everyday use and streaming videos. However, there are two issues I have encountered. One, the wifi reception is very poor, I have another Lenovo Legion laptop that gets full wifi signal anywhere in the house even far away from the modem, while this HP laptop gets very very weak signal if I am moderately far from the modem. second issue, this laptop gets too hot, even while doing relatively minor tasks, but the problem gets worse while it\\'s plugged in, the fans go crazy and both the laptop and the AC adapter overheat. Overall I wouldn\\'t recommend this laptop. As for as a laptop, that is all it is. The headphone jack stopped working after 3 months. The battery is meh, it drains pretty quickly if the laptop is off or in sleep. It takes forever to turn on, I legitimately thought it was broken when I first received it because of that. It also takes forever to come out of sleep. The review mentioned a touch screen, I don\\'t think it has one. If it does, mine does not work. Battery life not as long as stated. Laptop feels cheaper made thany last laptop. Screen quality seems good. Had a HP 15\" laptop and this one lacks some features but is smaller and lighter weight. good display and keyboard. It was amazing I loved how fast it was to set up a very cheap laptop for gaming Fast processor, quality in materials, well built!! Everything is good. Really like it Very useful and maneuverable equipment, comfortable to work Love it! Very satisfied😊 This laptop is amazing! As you can see in the image, the screen presents this problem and it is more visible when the background is white or light, I have not used a lot this laptop and it started to present this problem for some reason. This computer is complete TRAAASH! Don’t walk RUN! Keeps restarting and black screen every 2 mins. DO NOT RECOMMEND! HP needs to do better with their products! This computer literally disconnects it\\'s self from the internet every 1-3 minutes and I\\'m not even exaggerating. In a 24 hour day I experienced 30 minutes of solid fast internet, the rest of the time is just slow, constantly buffering, disconnecting and reconnecting. I\\'ve tried everything, updated everything, made sure no power saver is turning it off, no metal is near the laptop and after extensive research I can\\'t get anything close to answer because all the answers provided don\\'t actually work. I can\\'t even check my email without it disconnecting 5 times. Trash, absolute trash and I\\'m certainly returning this worthless computer because what good is a computer for streaming if it can\\'t stay connected. Got this. Working fine for a few weeks. But then I started getting the blue-screen-of-death-2022.\\n\\nGot a replacement computer through the great assistance from Prime-Member\\'s-customer-support. Got the replacement today and brand-new, but during the setup I got that same blue screen message.\\n\\nMoving on and away from HP and non-Intel-processors for a while. Computer worked great then went to open it up and turn it on and it doesn’t work! 55 days old. the battery won\\'t charge to full The laptop is fine but I\\'m deducting a star because the keyboard is not backlit. I own three very similar HP latptops purchased through Costco over the past two years. The Costco laptops were Intel powered i3 and i5 machines with the same 250 nits 14\" FHD screens, SSDs and backlit keyboards. This unit is very similar however it is AMD powered and the keyboard is not backlit. I tried my best to ensure that it was however I could not confirm on the web. So let me be the first to confirm it is not. I needed a smaller computer. My desktop took up too much space on my desk while working from home. This laptop has been great. I can put it away when not being used and put it in my bag and take it with me when traveling for work. I would buy it again. After seeing so many rough reviews I was a bit skeptical myself, but no worries this laptop is lovely! I\\'m months in and currently typing up this review on it. The keyboard is fantastic and satisfying. The mousepad is super responsive and has even a left and right side that have different features. Although the screen is not my favorite it still works well. This computer performs magically, but I do recommend installing extra ram onto this to rock its full potential. Overall beastly computer, take my word for it! Got this for my daughter after all of the chromebooks in the house died. It\\'s the perfect size/weight, and has enough spec to run all of her games and schoolwork. She loves it! Good deal This was purchased for my daughter and she LOVES IT!\\nFast, and great features.\\nThanks! I’m glad I tried this laptop. It gave me an appreciation for my 5-year-old model that has more speed and memory. I returned it knowing that I should buy at least an equivalent replacement. I’m not a gamer and\\nI have spent hours fixing touch screen problems. I bought it because it came without a touch screen and without enough gaming power. I was looking for updated features, but didn’t find any. Pretty much the same ol’ wrapped in pretty Windows 11 screens. The price was perfect for the quality. The narrow-margin anti-glare screen is beautiful. The camera doesn’t support the Windows “hello” feature. Start up is much slower than I expected. Without the experience of higher-end machines, this is a great choice. All good I ended up returning it because it doesn’t have an ethernet port. I didn’t know that not all computers have one. It seemed like it would be a great computer for a casual user. This is the first time I used an AMD processor, and I’m pleased. Works great! Love the light weight and awesome quality! Easy to travel with. Fast processor. Better than dell I like the size of this computer. It is lightweight. There is no touch screen. I purchased for work at home position and does a good job of keeping up with many programs open at one time. Battery life is an issue as it does not give you the full eight hours as described, I’m only able to get half that battery life. I purchased this so that I could have my original HP worked on with additional memory and Bluetooth. I think this one will work fine until that is complete. The keyboard is great and I love that it is raised. This far it does what I need. I absolutely don’t like that you have to log into Microsoft to set up. I also do not need the app feature and find that most laptops and windows are going that route. It’s annoying. Other than those issues, for the money it is thus far doing the job. I\\'ve only had this laptop a couple of days, but I really like it. I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior. The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide. This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case. The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop. Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop.\\nOk a little update. I do like this laptop a lot. I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn\\'t work right out of the box. I\\'m dumbfounded by these reviews. The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself.\\nThis device had a defective battery out of the box. I didn\\'t notice that until after a few days. I contacted H P and they were great to work with. They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good. H P offered to replace the battery free, but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery. I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop. They weren\\'t game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it. Well, being the kind of person I am, I went to my favorite retailer, Amazon, ordered the proper battery, replaced the dead one and now I have a great laptop with a good battery. I would still give it a 5 star review and recommend it to anyone. This was a great but for price paid. Great display, responsive keyboard, plenty of storage. It\\'s quick to boot up, and smoothly opens programs with unnoticeably wait time.\\n\\nYou\\'ll wanna buy one for everyone in your household. It is a good product but with very light materials, you have to take good care of it. Quick, and it doesn\\'t fry, I love it! Excellent item, I\\'m happy I bought it This isn\\'t compatible with the pricey HP Thunderbolt G2 dock. Not sure why a chromebook is but HP to HP won\\'t. Also I bought this Amazon used and the warranty was activated and only had 4 months left. Product itself seems nice though. very fast i truly like. did have one issue when starting to downloads origin for Sims but i found a forum from EA and fixed it\\nIt should’ve already been installed and up to date as a gamer pc however, it was used and i think cleared so anyway, it was easy to fix once i researched The laptop is working excellently I\\'ve been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference. This is the fastest one I\\'ve ever owned. I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books. This notebook is too great to use for just that. Can\\'t say enough good things about it. I bought this for my private practice and it works great. Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office. Analogue: Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it\\'s not a new iPhone. I am very happy with it. It runs faster than I expected, which was my biggest concern. I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the \\'no wifi\\' reviews; I actually thought that \\'I wont get one of those\\', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi, they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident. Is a good pc to work and watching movies but not for playing games Nice laptop, works as expected. It forgets the internet easily, if you leave your location and come back- so keep your eye out for that. Other than that there is not much to complain about. I was expecting something more mettalic heavy, but feels like a Asus talking about the body. Otherwise performance is good. Feels smooth and responsive. I\\'ve got the issue with the WiFi driver and Windows 11 but fixed looking and searching on the web. HP support didn\\'t help me at all.\\nI didn\\'t like that the keyboard is not backlight.\\nAlso it gets very overheated fast. I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing. I believe that the \"bloatware\" was interfering with it. I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail. It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging). I am now completely satisfied. Honestly, I know absolutely NOTHING about computers. I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like 2007 that didn\\'t even connect to the internet. In senior year of high school we had chrome books, and those were so simple to use. When I got this computer, it was intimidating and I struggled to figure it out. BUT even without support of microsoft amazon or hp I was able to fix the error code myself. The screen display is beautiful, bright, and perfect for me. I can\\'t wait to see how it does for my college courses and sims! I recommend it. It\\'s a perfect size, and VERY sleek girllllll (or guy I won\\'t discriminate lol)! When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.\\n\\nFirst, the cons:\\nIs it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn\\'t intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don\\'t buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn\\'t the brightest. The sound quality isn\\'t immersive. There is no optical drive.\\n\\nNow, the pros:\\nThe price. This is a 15\" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn\\'t for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn\\'t super speedy, but it isn\\'t unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn\\'t buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.\\n\\nWho should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.\\n\\n[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn\\'t?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.] LOL to the one-star reviews from people who can\\'t connect to Wi-Fi or used to some other brand and can\\'t figure out HP. It\\'s a computer! You have to either know how to use it, learn how to use it, or buy support. I\\'ve had this computer for 5 months and yes, yesterday I couldn\\'t connect to Wi-Fi. Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty. (I didn\\'t.) Started reading the reviews. But then I tried figuring out why my Wi-Fi isn\\'t connecting (via my cell phone). It took a while, I learned a lot of computer innards, and after successfully connecting to Wi-Fi, I\\'m typing this review from it. Wi-Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop. The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program.\\nThis laptop is great! Superfast! Pages load instantly - something I wasn\\'t used to with my previous laptops. Plenty of space for all my \"stuff\" in the form of photos, videos, family trees, and also my husband\\'s business programs, logs, documents and files. I\\'m very happy we bought it, so therefore 5-star review. Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only 2 months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back - occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time…. This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi- this needs to be addressed I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck 🚛 deal. I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless. I have had no such issues nor any other issues. Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally. I find I never have to wait on it to do anything. It boots up faster than any previous PC I\\'ve had. Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost. Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it! Very pleased with this product. Wife has no complaints and computer functions quite well. Great price! Excellent performance. My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me. That said, I bought it for my children to use, so might not be a problem. Picked this up for my 85 year old dad. Very fast machine, nice and light. Trackpad clicking isnt as smooth as more expensive machines and keyboard feel is just ok. Would totally get again if on sale. I use this HP Laptop for personal use as well as for my Prayer Group duties. I maintain membership lists as well as other related lists. I create ads for our events and send them via email to our rectory for insertion in the church\\'s bulletin. Our other HP Laptop has been in use for these purposes since 2016. Since my husband has been using the other laptop more frequently, (writing novels), I decided to get one for myself. This way I have access whenever I want it. I fully expect this Laptop to serve me as well as the older one did. I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school. I needed something quickly, but I wanted quality. I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes. I am so happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze, it took maybe 5 minutes, and maybe an extra 5 for the updates. The picture is crisp and clear, it has great sound, the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read. I purchased the windows 11 version and have no regrets. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in. With the exception of heavy gaming, I can\\'t imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn\\'t be able to do for work or for school. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it. All our programs are cloud hosted so we didn\\'t need anything super powerful. This laptop is actually overkill for accessing our web based program and Microsoft 365 but we bought these for longevity over any i3. The i3 models just don\\'t last as long and tend to get slow much sooner than this i5 model. Dozens purchased, no issues so far. Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task. The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn\\'t hold a charge longer than 10 minutes. After five months the laptop won\\'t work unless plugged in. I don\\'t do a lot of gaming, but it\\'s great for Microsoft 365, email and shopping. The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are. Until I learned where the \\'end\\' key was, for instance, I struggled to see it. Still it\\'s a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it. Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for. Works well with Teams, video quality is ok, but I\\'m not using it for gaming. Only 1 HMDI port- which is kind of annoying when you\\'d like to connect it to multiple monitors. Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi- which is inconvenient (to put it mildly) when you need to be online for work. Other than that it\\'s an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it\\'s supposed to. This is feedback from my Daughter who I had it sent to as a gift. HP is typically good equipment. The components and spec in the AD appear to be a solid unit for it\\'s intended purpose. I\\'ll send an update upon hearing further information. Computer works well and seems a good value. Enjoy Windows 11. Had one glitch when it dropped internet and struggled to get reconnected. Thought we might have either software or hardware issue. Did finally get it back, but normally it would be an easy reconnect just by finding a viable WiFi signal. Not the case. If it occurs again, we’ll deal with HP to see if we have a hardware issue; reason for a 4-star rating. Otherwise, it was easy to set up and connect with printer and monitor. And, it’s really lightweight so easy to travel with in my backpack. We bought this computer to replace one that was \"irredeemable\". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3. I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better. The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day. This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it. The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails. The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support. We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year. (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft \"updated\" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they \"updated\" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. At that point I was loud and angry. I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware. \"You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it\". I said I would not pay such ransom ware money. I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the \"automatic update button\". I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.) An update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack. I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. If I don\\'t receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. If that doesn\\'t work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.) Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back. I hope I remember the name \"Tech Deals Store\" and never buy from these people again. I purchased this to replace my 13 year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing, social media, emailing, photo retouching, and Word/powerpoint/excel projects.\\n\\nThis HP is everything I needed, and more! Windows 11 is much more user-friendly than Windows 10. The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal. It starts up quick, and holds a charge for at least 8 hours.\\nBest of all, it\\'s lightweight and thin, so traveling is a breeze.\\n\\nBonus: it is bluetooth compatible, so I can make/answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room.\\nAnother bonus: numeric keypad!\\n\\nThe only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back-lit keyboard, but I\\'m not sweating the small stuff. I don’t have any issue with the screen display and no issue connecting to Microsoft account and store. It worked right out of the box! I just have to set up some things before the first use.The keyboard could have a backlit display for use at night time tho! The keyboard itself is a little bit confusing because it has so many buttons that are unnecessary, people don’t use that much of extra things that’s on this keyboard. The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho! I am happy with it. I don’t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube. I don’t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram, but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it’s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience. Everyone has their own preference! The only suggestion I have is to buy your laptop directly from Amazon not from marketplace sellers! If you need to customize your laptop specifications I suggest you buy from bestbuy and from the manufacturers. Happy shopping 🛍😊 For this price this laptop is amazing. I use this for gaming and college and it runs great. Very durable and can run bigger games like sims and castlevania. My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I\\'m working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I\\'m able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I\\'m able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints. its light weight, and the keys are large and easy to press, comes with windows installed and its a fast booter and runs smooth, perfect and will do the job This laptop is very responsive, very fast. i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy, I find it sturdy. The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop. Other wise, a very good laptop. Let me preface this by saying, I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers. Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews. I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review. Overall, I’m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it! HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse. Laptop looks new! No scratches or marks.\\n\\nRuns smoothly after three months. I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse! I just needed a computer for home use and this one fit the bill. I bought it refurbished and I couldn\\'t be happier. Perfect condition and no issues. equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price. It’s nice. Had issues w it not staying connected to the WiFi though. Had to tamper w the bios to get it to finally work. i love the SSD and the I5. not too crazy about windows 11. Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos.exe. But, I love the computer, especially the boot time (<10 seconds) It is light, easy to use and install. I bought it for my daughter for college and she loves it. I bought this for school to make digital art and animation. It works well for those purposes, but I\\'ve honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games. Pretty much everything from like PS3/360 era and before can run at high settings fairly stably. I don\\'t think it can even launch most newer triple A games, so I haven\\'t even tried. The screen is bright and easy to view, however, the keypad is difficult to view unless you have light right on top of the computer. The keys are labeled in silver with the overall keyboard also in silver. I had to call in a professional I.T. person to set-up the computer. Windows 11 created major problems for him and took him hours of research to solve the problems (especially with the HP printer) and he has been working with computers for over 20 years! Pro:\\nGood price. Nice size، easy to handle ، light weight ، good battery life\\nCon:\\nDull screen. Not enough brightnrss. If I knew this is how the screen is going to look, I would have not purched this laptop. This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there\\'s a learning process. I\\'m using it to start working at home. My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters, etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys. Great I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.\\n\\nI wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available. I am still experimenting with this little girl, but I am very pleased. I do not game, so didn\\'t enter a comment. Very smooth operation, speedy - I\\'ve not used this version of Windows, so taking my time to test drive newer applications. BUT, very pleased. Would recommend. I got this laptop from the treasure truck. I have been wanting a new laptop so it was perfect timing. This laptop was really easy to get set up. I haven\\'t had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it\\'s much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work. It\\'s not a touch screen, which I really like. I might use it for video games at some point but that\\'s not my main priority with this laptop. It is ideal for my step-daughter\\'s on line tutoring. She absolutely loves it. Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it’s too early to rate but so far I’m very pleased. It’s very slim and lightweight. The set up was super easy. It boots up almost instantly. The key board is easy to maneuver. The built in mouse pad works extremely well. The screen quality is very good & the monitor is bright. I only use it for basic things like email, social media, research, on line shopping, etc so it fits my needs perfectly. The battery life is decent. It came loaded with Windows 11 which is great but unfortunately Windows 11 is not compatible with my printer. The trade off is that Windows 11 is far superior to Windows 10 in all other respects. The test will be to see how long it all holds up. I’m optimistic though! The brand makes very good products, it works excellent, but for the amount that I end up paying, I would have preferred to buy a 15.6-inch one, since I was charged twice for the import. One is charged by AMAZON at the time of purchase and you also pay the import to the FEDEX Mexico parcel service at the time of delivery. I\\'m still learning how to use the features. As far as I know it does not have a touch screen. It has issues connecting to the internet/wi-fi after updating. It does not have a place to connect an ethernet cable which I should have checked before buying. It allows me to do what I need to do so far. I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account. The computer works perfectly. Media Tek MT 7921 WiFi 6 802.ax adapter does not consistently start from the sleep mode. Every 3 to 6 days it goes dead. Same condition happens with both 2.4 and 5 GHz. It can be recovered by completely powering off and turning it back on. This might have to be done a couple of times. The driver version is 3.0.1.1167 and is the current driver per HP\\'s web page. The laptop works OK with a Cat 6 internet connection. A UNI USB C to Ethernet adapter cable is required as well as a Cat 6 cable direct to a router port. An extra expense to keep it running. This is a workaround till I can find time to work with HP. I would like to install a new wi-fi adapter. Very nice laptop at this price point ($500). No back light of course, also no User Manual as far as I can tell. Would buy it again. This laptop is more for social Media app games etc. It\\'s good but very little memory and the screen resolution is poor I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one. The screen is huge! The processing apeed is okay too. It\\'s just that i\\'m not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard. The letters shift to the left because of the additional numbers on the right side. Other than that, it is very good quality laptop and I\\'m satisfied qith it. Sometimes when I write on social media, E-mails ect, if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it. Could be my fault. Otherwise I like it. My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed. I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money. It arrived in very good condition 😊 Starts very fast, good price. I got this computer because I wanted an affordable pc after years of macs and hating their keyboard. A couple things I have notice about this computer…\\n\\nKeyboard and pad are nice, good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark. And to right click on the track pad still confuses me.\\n\\nScreen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting.\\n\\nComputer is a little flimsy when folding/unfolding.\\n\\nWindows 11 I am actually pretty happy with. Takes a little getting used to but I like the os.\\n\\nOverall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy. You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for. Fast computer for college. Clear screen. My Kindle books are crystal clear We purchased this for my dad for Christmas. It is his first ever laptop. It\\'s great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on. He absolutely loves it! I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books. it\\'s not built for gaming at all. I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews. But I’m glad that I did because my pc arrived early, and in good quality, I’m in love. And yes it’s for gaming also because I played on it, and it performed well. If you’re thinking about getting this DO IT!!!!! Don’t listen to these people (most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it) For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd. The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use. Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive. Glad I bought this. I love my new laptop! It is fast and works really good! So far I have not had any problems with the Laptop Only 2 weeks into using it and all is good so far. I’ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences. I think this will also be a good purchase. This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in 2013. I was not unhappy with my 8+ year old machine, but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation, and the battery needed replacement. The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice.\\n\\nI found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials, or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software. I am still in the transfer process. This is disappointing. I use this laptop for work, especially spreadsheets and data every and I\\'m very pleased with the quality. Very easy to set up Its okay so far. I\\'ve had it for less than a month and the battery does pretty fast, I don\\'t even use it often. No touchscreen Very nice it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user. After some struggle now the laptop is usable, support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support. i bought it when from Treasure Truck, i got very good discount...i already use it for a while, everything work very well so far... love this laptop I have an HP at work - like everything about it. When it was time to replace my old computer I chose an HP for home use. Very happy with it so far. I\\'m not a gamer. I use it for e-mail, internet , and tax preparation. Great laptop, plenty fast for home recording with no latency. I\\'ve had it for about 6 months now with absolutely no issues. The review says to rate the touch screen, but there is not a touch screen. I purchased 2 adapters - one for the Ethernet connection and one for the mouse. Would have liked another USB port. The keyboard has a good feel, but the shiny silver with the thin letters, is annoying for me. Installation was fine once I got past all the questions that were asked. Speed is very good. Have installed several HP computers in the past. Don\\'t place this at the top. I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you...it could take jamming! Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional. I have absolutely no issues with this laptop. In fact, i will be buying one for my son for his birthday! Definitely recommend. I thought I was purchasing a new gaming laptop. I\\'m pretty sure it was refurbished and it is definitely NOT for gaming! It has many glitches, sometimes drops internet and now the camera refuses to work even though it is downloaded. It is now more like a beautiful paperweight than a working computer. crappy tin keypad, locks up alot. It\\'s 1 of those laptops that you took the battery out to restart, only now you push every key with your palm to get it responding, has to be much better one for half the money out their If I could have figured out how to clear what we already put on the laptop I would have returned it Excellent value for the price. Had everything I needed tbh A big thanks to Techno Panda on YouTube for the review and recommendation. I added another 8 GB RAM as soon as I got this new PC and it works really well. Restarts quickly. Chrome browser opens quickly. Can handle demanding tasks like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro CC with little or no delay. I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back. I can\\'t believe how crappy the screen quality is. My 5+ year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing. The last laptop I bought was in 2010... is it a requirement now that you need to spend $1000+ for anything decent? This was a gift for my son and he loved it very much! It\\'s good for both homework and games. Bought it as a surprise for my grandaughter and she loves it.. She has always liked mine and has wanted one like it.. One of the best laptops I have ever owned.. I like HP products and this computer is not an exception. My earlier, older, slower, and heavier laptop died between Zoom meetings. So it was research time and get an order placed, was I ever surprised when two days later I had a new laptop and was set up and handling everything like before. Working great with Chrome where many of my files were stored. The computer was good looking and pretty responsive. The screen had a sharp image. But that\\'s as far as I got. I had the computer running a total of about 1 1/2 hours when it put up a blue screen and froze! Will I get another HP? I\\'d like to think this is \"one-in-a-million\" but I do get dubious. This laptop is probably just fine for someone else, but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting. Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop, and can also be used in place of a password for many websites. My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference. It was a mistake to order this laptop. This laptop has everything I need without paying a high price. Nice to look at, super thin and light weight, and was easy to set up, and it came with Windows 11! I love my new HP laptop. The quality this laptop is all it was advertised to do. I am so very pleased. For the price its a great laptop does everything i need it to do. great buy, my 2 kids love them Gear fit and finish. Very well known brand that holds up to its name well. Unfortunately we got this as a gift for someone overseas, so unable to return it (or I would have). As others have mentioned, this keyboard has gray letters on silver keys. Almost no contrast unless you have perfect lighting (so in real life it often won\\'t be anywhere as good as they picture they posted). Unfortunately the first times I used it before sending it off was daytime with excellent lighting, so I managed to get by. But in less than perfect lighting, it\\'s a real strain to see the keys. I searched in vain to see if they had backlight (which is the only thing that could have saved things). Also, minimal tactile feedback. Unless you plan to always use an external keyboard, stay away from this laptop. Such a shame they never got user feedback on this keyboard design. So much faster than any laptop I have had! I had to get one with lots of RAM and SSD. This would have been a bargain at twice the price! I loved it, it\\'s not heavy, it\\'s fast, it has installed everything I need, anti virus. I recommend it 100% Excellent very good quality Well worth the money. Good basic laptop for my middle school aged daughter. Everything works and she is happy with it. So far no issues and it functions as it should. Bought this for my daughter for online school and she loves it. Wish it had a backlight for the keyboard but otherwise I have no issue with it. Great speed and easy to navigate. Only had this laptop for a short while but so far so good. Easy to navigate, clear screen. No issues to date. Slowest computer I have ever had. Only purchased to use adobe and editing software as I have a chromebook that does everything else but does not support adobe software. I have had HP in the past and hoped for a better experience since the last time I purchased an HP was in 2011 for college, however…. All other features are fine. Just, very slow loading 😵\\u200d💫 Got this for my college Freshman daughter, she absolutely loves it!! So light to carry around campus, fast connections, and the battery lasts all (class) day. Not to mention all the non class things she does( Facebook, reading, streaming, ETC) I was concerned about not having a backlit keyboard and no touchscreen, however the keyboard is really fine and easy to see. The touchscreen is really not missed. This is value for you money. Great! Display and quality screen. If I needed another one would definitely purchase again. Who ever thought of silver keys with light gray numbers and letters should lose their job. Barely visible even if your are directly looking at them. Almost makes me feel like returning it just for that reason. Other than that it\\'s a decent computer. Liking it so far. Quiet and fast. Decent battery life. Light weight is nice Miss my Dell touch screen and backlit keyboard. Otherwise, decent quality. The shift key for @ sign for email comes out as \". The shift \" comes out as @. Update. Apparently I set the language as English UK instead of English USA. Working fine now. Great for gaming. Use it all the time for the sims.., worth it The laptop is great for the price point. Just think of the laptops before touch screen and 2-in-1. Very pleased with this purchase. Great laptop for the price, wish it had a larger SSD drive. I talked two of my friends into buying this laptop also. This computer has had issues with connecting to 2.4 WiFi connection. Super slow connection and keeps going out when other device have no issues.\\nThe backlight is super dim, even at the brightest setting.\\nI also struggled to get this computer connected to two monitors. May have been the adaptor, but the adaptor worked with two other computers.\\nOverall, I got this one for the extra ram and faster processor, but it feels slower than my old one.\\nNot sure what the overall problem is. This laptop works like a charm. No complaints! Responds quickly, has good battery life. Really amazing laptop only thing i wish had a better battery and backlit keyboard but that is my own personal preference. The laptop itself I 100% recommend. Just the right memory, etc. for my home office needs. Very thin, build quality is nice, great performance. I upgraded my RAM from 8 gb to 16 gb. I want to start by saying that I love the big screen and Microsoft office runs well on the computer, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why it is so fickle when it comes to wifi connectivity. Sometimes it connects to wifi with no problems, but other times it won\\'t even register that there is wifi available let alone connect to it. It is incredibly frustrating and you probably need a computer that connects to the internet so I would not recommend this computer. Works great! I needed thiz. Enjoy the functions, but no CD ROM Average price more computer than needed for the person I gifted it to The screen very well everything worked just great. was delivered to my us imaginary address, then forwarded by our logistics company outside the us, arrived safe and sound. works so far so good-knock knock. The computer arrived securely packaged. It looks and performs just as advertised. Although it doesn\\'t have a touchscreen, it performs well otherwise. Product was in excellent condition Nice screen quality, great for gaming Great job The computer looks and feels sleek. It’s a powerful unit. But it doesn’t matter at all when windows 11 has a fault that will endlessly disconnect the wireless network adapter inside the laptop itself. If you can afford something newer, or ever run windows 10 for the time being, I recommend that highly. I’m so pissed at this laptop, I’ve probably reset the network settings and restarted it 10,000 times in 3 months. Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she’s enjoying it immensely Had no issues. Product was fine, and shipping was quick. I thought I had bought the right la too. But the battery dies really fast. Don’t recommend it. I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck. But like many of the other reviews stated, there is constantly issues with the WiFi. Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep, the next time I boot it up, WiFi cannot be located. Long story short…..I returned the damn thing. This new computer was a Christmas gift for our daughter and it is perfect for her daily use. Like it was easy to fire it up I like it lighter then the old one I ordered it with shipping to Honduras (through a mailbox in Miami and it arrived in perfect condition. I loved it. It\\'s super fast 😁 It’s fast, it’s easy to use, and it was just as advertised! Needed a new one My husband really likes this laptop. With the clear screen. And easy to use process. He uses it everyday. This was a Christmas present for my wire, she was very happy with it. Love it so far and very fast. Fast shipping too Laptop did a system update that deleted the wifi drive. Tried many options, but cannot restore wifi. Tried to restore to factory settings, but now windows won’t even open. Did a google search an learned this is a popular problem many had with their laptops as well.\\n***UPDATE***\\nAmazon support transferred me to HP since it is still under 1yr manufacture warranty. After long calls and multiple attempts, HP support was able to restore to factory settings. I missed days of work, lost records, had to get my computer setup for work all over again. I was told I could seek compensation, I would have to send in a company letter head stating the amount of pay I lost. After a week of calls from their supervisors who kept escalating the issue, I got the end user. He claimed there is no such thing as compensation and that all the previous supervisors lied to me. I was offered a $25 coupon for a future HP product. I\\'m going back to MAC. It\\'s a great laptop for the price! Very good FAST DELIVERY. PACKAGED WELL. PLENTY FAST COMPUTER SPEED WITH 8GB RAM AND SSHD. So far so good. A nice product. online banking bill paying shopping love the speed Nice laptop, excellent delivery time Replacement laptop for my last HP. Lightweight and good battery life. This is the traditional computer I needed. I got it at good price on Cyber Monday. Good performance small but nice Easy setup, good battery life and nice screen Easy to use , mainly used for research, gmail. MF Could not see very clear as I have low vision. Thank you The laptop is a standard laptop, no extras which is what I needed. Two weeks into owning the laptop, the WiFi completely disappeared off it and all the computer was detecting was a LAN. I factory reset the computer and all was fine for two more weeks, when I woke up and did it again. Had to send back the computer for a full refund, luckily I was still in the window for returning it. Super light and very fast, finally a beautiful computer Very nice computer, ideal for personal use and business. Not too happy with the device. Overall performs weaker than my last computer at the same price point (also HP) with less features (touch screen, can turn into a tablet by folding). I would personally return this if I didnt get it online and had to deal with shipping back and forth. Great laptop for the money Excellent quality good performance The laptop was perfect at first, exactly what I needed, but it\\'s been 5 months and I\\'ve already taken it to support twice.\\nThe first time was about a month ago because it stopped connecting to wifi, it didn\\'t even show the networks. Then, I woke up today with an alert that said that the fan and the battery weren\\'t working properly and the keyboard was all messed up (the letters are pressed forever). How do a fan and a battery break after 5 months of normal use?\\nI bought it and came back to Argentina (where I live), and there\\'s no HP support here so I just have to keep taking it and paying more money to get it fixed.\\nBuy something else. So far so good!! the windows 11 is a none friendly system that a middle tech. average person can not use to it\\'s full advantage and should not be advert. in that manor For starters this was a warehouse deals. Always know that they\\'re hit or miss. This laptop seemed great at first. Booted up. Went through the setup process. So good. Did the updates. No issues. Then I noticed internet speeds slow. Weird. Forced 5ghz. Speeds up. Then wifi died. Weird. Turn off laptop. Power button to turn on no response. Tried again next day, nothing. 3rd day powers on but wifi still not working so I say ok time to send this back after I do a factory reset. Factory reset not working glitch in windows 11. Downloaded a USB win11 imagine to do a fresh install but it wouldn\\'t find the storage. Had to load the driver manually what a pain. I purchased this laptop from Treasure Truck. It was at a wonderful price. Typically, when I choose to purchase electronics from Amazon I am offered an extended warranty. I was not offered a warranty for this machine so I looked up the item at the regular price and the extended warranty option was listed. I called Amazon to setup and purchase the guarantee, but was told to contact the manufacturer. I contacted HP several times (could not connect to a human) so I entered the serial number as instructed, but the HP system indicated it had no record of the machine’s serial number. This transaction seemed suspicious to me so I returned the item. Not good. The keys were loose and the plastic holding the keys in place was warped and very flimsy. The overall feel of the computer is very cheap for the price tag. I couldn\\'t say much about the battery or specs because to be honest, I opened it up and noticed straight out the box it was such low quality. I Just sent it back for a refund. I had the exact same wi-fi network issues as everyone else has mentioned. I bought this for graduate school and online classes - I need a more dependable wifi computer than this one. The Troubleshooting recommended attaching an ethernet chord, but there is no ethernet port to connect to on the laptop. I tried resetting my modem and restarting the computer multiple times, to no avail. The laptop isn\\'t recognizing ANY network - phone hotpsot or internet modem. I tried registering it on HP and the product number cannot be found, so I was SOL on HP tech support too. I\\'m processing a return today. loved all\\' when I turned it on and signed in I could not make a desktop icon. Not a big deal, but there was no information on the internet on how to fix it besides making a custom shortcut. But in doing so you don\\'t get the icon. so instead of making a custom icon for something i bought brand new I contacted support. it took me almost an hour to actually talk to a person, it took the person 12 minutes to before they actually gave me half a response related to my issue. They stated that it was a software issue and I needed to contact their SmartFriend support. You need to pay for that service. So the brand new laptop i had just opened without installing anything on it had a software problem they wouldn\\'t try and resolve without me paying for help. This is a great brand and business. I bought this to replace my current i3 Dell, which is 6 years old. It has slowed down considerably, and it constantly loses its wifi connection. At first, about a year ago, it would happen once or twice a week, but now it happens every few minutes. NOT my wifi. All other devices work fine. I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago, and it only made it worse. I need reliable WIFI for my job, to attend Zoom and Teams meetings. Out of the box, I was impressed with this model\\'s speed and connectivity. But, I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home, it would not connect again. It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished. It\\'s only a week old. I\\'m returning this and going back to Dell. I got this as one of the Treasure Truck deals and was excited to use it. I\\'ve had it for 7 days and didn\\'t even use it every day. I opened it tonight and there was no internet connection! Upon investigation there was no wifi device detected. I\\'m so upset. I opened reviews here and saw a long review that covered this same problem in detail. I immediately initiated the return and requested a refund. It worked fine until I did the Windows update and then the wifi disappeared like it never existed. >:-( WIFI adapter stopped working just over 3 months of having this laptop. HP said since this is software issue, (and software warranty is just 3 months and hardware warranty is 1 year), I can pay ~$50 for them to help me fix this issue (for the first month).\\n\\nWhen I have taken it in to my university to have them fix it, they told me for some reason the laptop will not accept the new software from either HP or Intel website. Going to have to factory reset my laptop 3.5 weeks into a new laptop. Lap top is no longer accepting WiFi... says something about hook up to Ethernet cable....doesn\\'t make sense This laptop worked for just under a month, and then the wireless card gave out. All of my devices, including my 4 year old HP Envy laptop are connecting just fine to my network. I\\'ve restarted, run diagnostics, and still nothing. It continues to say there are no networks available, which means that the wireless card isn\\'t working, at all. It\\'s not even finding other local networks let alone mine. Since this thing doesn\\'t have an Ethernet cable port, it\\'s useless now since I can\\'t connect to the internet with it. Returned. Thought this to be an ok mid- priced unit. Liked it at first. Then it kept dropping off line. The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting. This happened about every 5-10 minutes. Two other computers in my house do not do that. Internet is fine. Sent it back as defective. They deducted $91.47 as a restocking fee. FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE. Do not buy this unit. Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly. Just about 7 weeks after its April 29th delivery, this computer booted up to a different interface and we could not get the system back to its normal function despite the many options shown on the screen including selecting the option to do a fresh install of windows, system restore, etc. I am now left with a fancy shell of an inoperable device. I thought we were getting a nice, basic, laptop for my senior mother. It was nice for a few weeks then started having issues and eventually the option for wifi completely disappeared. After 10+ hours troubleshooting with windows and it’s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period. I don’t recommend this device. It is flimsy- which is a little expected considering price. Also not a touch screen. Overall I would not recommend this laptop. I only used it a couple of days when I got up one morning and it wouldn\\'t pick up any wifi networks. I tried to find out why, but there was nothing showing as to why it wouldn\\'t find any networks. So I had to once again break out my old, outdated laptop.\\n\\nWhile I was able to use it, it was working OK. The only issue I had with it was I was unable to unlock and move the taskbar. When left clicking the taskbar, only \"taskbar settings\" would show up, with no option to unlock it. I am waiting to see if Amazon / HP will honor the warranty. My laptop developed vertical lines less than 3 months after i bought it. Based on a test it was determinized that it was a hardware issue. The laptop was not subject to abuse. I am a 62 year old granny that keeps my laptop in my home. I do not carry my laptop around.\\nI will let you know if Amazon / HP make it good. Thanks Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon. The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it. It had a \"second life\" used/refurbished sticker affixed to it. I looked up the serial number on HP\\'s website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it 3 months ago.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in this laptop, I\\'d suggest you look for it elsewhere. I can\\'t trust Amazon to send a new unit. Do not buy! Within a month of purchasing, the wireless adapter just suddenly stopped working and disappeared. Upon further reading of the reviews of this computer, apparently this is a common problem. So save yourself the frustration and avoid buying this. I\\'m giving Amazon high marks for giving me the option to return it for a full refund without hassle. I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out. Set it up and then one day later it wouldn\\'t identify the WiFi. I tried network reset , reset adapter but nothing worked. Had to send it back. Don\\'t buy this one. There is some problem with the WiFi adapter. This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up. I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working. I’ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it. I’m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window Barely two weeks after having received the laptop, the wifi drivers are barely working. The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections.\\n\\nYesterday, no amount of restarts worked, and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished. I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working. Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery. Sending mines back. Wifi function routinely disappears. The fix is spending hours on the phone with hp while they completely wipe the laptop and reinstall everything. Really handy. 👌 AND since there\\'s no ethernet port, it\\'s basically the most worthless laptop available. Purchased brand new. Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in. There\\'s also a fun bug in Windows 11 that turns off the wifi by itself and won\\'t let you turn it back unless you do a full power-down (I\\'ve run all Windows updates). Restarting the computer doesn\\'t fix the issue. Pretty bummed out that I\\'ve only had this a few months and it\\'s a complete lemon. Not sure I\\'ve had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before. I’ve had this laptop for less than 24 hours and there is no Wi-Fi capacity only VPN or Ethernet! In 2022 that is totally unacceptable! Don’t waste your time or your money. I spent over an hour on the phone with HP only to have the representative hang up on me when she wasn’t able to identify the issue. Thankfully Amazon will refund my money but in the meantime I will have to go buy a working PC that actually has Wi-Fi capability. Worked fine for few months and then started loosing internet connection requiring to connect repeatedly.. but now, it won’t connect to internet at all. Tried to get support on chat but wasn’t helpful .. tried resetting etc including factory reset and nothing works. I enjoy the product a lot until it crash! Touch screen? Nope.\\nTouchpad? If you are holding the laptop every part of it acts like a touchpad, but only when it\\'s not supposed to. Aggravating to say the least. [Perhaps it\\'s a new feature designed to prevent people from spending too much time on social media.] The product page for the HP 15-dy5024nr is unremarkable, in that it does not really let you know what product line this HP laptop is part of. It\\'s also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are, without getting one.\\n\\nFor the curious, the loadout is as follows:\\nIntel Core i5-1235U - this is a 12th gen Alder Lake part with 4P cores (with HT), and 2E cores (10 threads)\\nWDC PC SN530 256GB - this is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD\\n8GB of DDR4 (ick)\\n\\nThe machine is pretty fast, but the 8GB of RAM is a strange choice, considering it\\'s a 10T CPU. The screen is 1920x1080, and it appears to be an IPS panel. The screen is clear, but peak brightness is only average. The Xe IGP graphics are better than older Intel IGPs, but it\\'s still not up to the level of what you\\'d get with an RDNA APU - much less a gGPU. If you\\'re a gamer, you\\'ll want to look elsewhere. The large 15.6\" footprint makes a large keyboard possible. The spacing is good, and the chicklet keys aren\\'t bad, but you will get a get a decent amount of clatter and flex while typing. It\\'s not a premium experience, but I still found it easier to type on this keyboard than on most laptops. The SSD, while a 4x unit, is about half the speed of \"nice\" PCIe 3.0 x4 units. I really didn\\'t find it to be a bottleneck for normal business workloads, but it wasn\\'t great when I would install massive NPM packages. The wifi capability is provided by a MediaTek MT7921 802.11ax. The card and onboard antennas work fine. Battery capacity is not stellar, and I would not expect to get more than 4 or 5 hours out of a charge. The power supply is physically tiny, with a 45W capacity. Unfortunately, there\\'s no USB PD charging here. External connectivity consists of two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI port, a USB-C port, a combo headphone/mic jack, an full-size SD card reader. No Thunderbolt here. The front-facing webcam is better than some, but still not good. The speakers are top-firing, and are better than many in this laptop price class. By that, I mean that they get sufficiently loud. No, they\\'re not great, but they\\'re fine - perfectly adequate for YouTube, podcasts, and even the occasional Netflix movie.\\n\\nAt $625, this HP laptop is in a weird spot... It\\'s definitely in a different performance tier than the $300-$450 laptops. It actually feels like a modded car... the CPU outclasses the rest of the machine, with the 8GB of RAM feeling like the biggest constraint. In reality, though, the 8GB is just fine for several browser tabs + Office 365. I\\'ve run several instances of VS Code at once, with Node+Express running in each. If you don\\'t care about a machined aluminum case, an all-day battery, or a dGPU, and you JUST want good performance at the $625 price point, this is a great laptop. Conditionally Recommended Reasonable computer for a good deal. Quality was weak, flexible in areas it shouldn’t be. Mine had sound issues where if the laptop was tipped sound would go out and sound bad. Also if you pushed in the middle of the keyboard or by the speakers it would go out as well. Returned for refund. As soon as I plugged in this \"new\" laptop it popped up with the name Andres Garcia and asked for a PIN. There were also a bunch of old saved wifi addresses. This was definitely not a new, or even a professionally refurbished laptop. This was almost certainly stolen and resold. DO NOT BUY Died just outside the amazon protection window just under 4 months after purchasing. HP has non-existent customer service so good luck getting your 1 year manufacturer warranty. The HP Laptop 15-dy5024nr is capable of web surfing and checking email and maybe a little Microsoft word. It is full of the usual HP bloat ware most of which can be uninstalled. This is not a gaming laptop. I installed the online game Runescape and it was able run ok but No Man’s Sky ran for a few seconds and shut down, probably due to a memory problem. With only 8 GB of ram and a 256 GB SSD, it is very limited. It is small, light and mostly plastic. There are no user serviceable panels to remove to upgrade ram etc. There is no user manual that I am aware of that explains how to do anything to this laptop. I believe you can remove the entire back to gain access to the ram and SSD. I may do this at a later date and will post pictures if I do. According to online memory sellers, the ram is upgradable to a max of 64 GB with 2 DDR4 PC4-25600 3200MHz SODIMM NON-ECC Unbuffered 260pin 1.2V CL22 sticks for a cost of around $200. To upgrade to 32 GB it will cost over $80. The SSD can be upgraded to 500 GB ($55) or 1 TB ($95). This laptop does not have a CD/DVD, Display Port or a USB port for charging the laptop. It does have a full size HDMI Port, a USB C 3.0 data port and 2 USB A 3.0 data ports. It also has a head phone/microphone port and a full size SD card reader and of course a port for the charging cable. All ports tested and worked as expected. The keyboard is chicklet style but works well and the touch pad works well also. The speakers are loud enough. I connected a wireless mouse with no problem. I used the USB C port to connect to my Galaxy S20+ 5G cell phone and all worked as expected. It has a camera for Skype or other video call software. The screen is bright and looks good to me. The Wi-Fi works great. This laptop works well for Web Surfing and email but if you want to do more you will need to upgrade.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nI installed Crucial RAM 32GB Kit (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz CL22 (or 2933MHz or 2666MHz) Laptop Memory CT2K16G4SFRA32A for $92.33 and a Team Group MP33 M.2 2280 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4 with NVMe 1.3 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) for $62.63 and everything works great. No Man’s Sky game plays great now. As promised, I posted pictures in the video. I hope this helps. Of course, if you attempt these upgrades, it will most probably void your warranty. This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use. The build quality is great with no issues. The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots. The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions.\\n\\nThe Intel Core i5-1235U packs enough processing power for it\\'s intended usage, but only having 8GB of ram does bring some concern when considering long term usage. Windows 11 runs snappy and smooth with this configuration, but the drawback is you cannot upgrade the memory. This laptop as configured is more than enough power for daily task at home or at work. I did drop a star because of the inability to upgrade the memory. With that out of the way, this is a solid laptop.\\n\\nGames can be played on this laptop, but be mindful of the specs. This is not intended to be a gaming laptop. Yes, it can play games, but it will not compete with a dedicated gaming laptop.\\n\\nDuring long usage the bottom does heat up. It\\'s as expected with this CPU, it\\'s not a deal breaker. The battery life is good.\\n\\nI did install Ubuntu in dual boot mode. Linux runs great and everything was detected. I use Linux a lot daily along with Windows. Internet worked 3 day until 4th day internet didn’t work at all took to Best Buy said internet broken defect computer totally junk beware junkyard computer I bought two of these. Mine suddenly lost Wi-Fi connectivity, even a complete reset didn’t fix the issue. My wife’s glitched from day one and did not run smooth. During setup the computer froze up, wasn\\'t able to connect too wifi, wasn\\'t able to fix the problem with HP tech support This is decent laptop , light weight and thin computer ! Keys are large and keyboard overall is very comfortable and easy to read. As every HP laptop, it is good quality ! Processor 12th Generation Intel Core i5-1235U will boot this computer almost instantly ! I would say speed is outstanding ! So far I do not have any problems with this laptop . With this processor , 8GB DDR4 RAM and 256GB of SSD performances will be above expectations . In my case, battery will not last more than 2.5 hours. Using this computer for online meetings and most of the time creating presentations. Battery charger is good ,will take about 90 minutes to charge the battery 100%\\nI would recommend this computer ! Cheap made and flimsy This laptop is great for those on a budget and need something to do the basics with like browsing the web, emails, videos etc. The laptop itself came packaged nicely to avoid any damage, once i got it out set it to charge for a couple hours. Setup was relatively easy took roughly about 30 minutes with some updates. Once setup was done did some browsing which was pretty smooth, watched some youtube videos and didn\\'t have any issues. Processing wise it\\'s not the best and would easily get bogged down if you are doing too much at once but for this price point it\\'s a great laptop. TL;DR:\\n--------\\nDecent entry level laptop with barely enough resources for basic computing. Plenty of the standard HP bloatware preinstalled. Only 8GB of ram and CANNOT upgrade! There are MUCH better options out there at this price point ($624)\\n\\nREVIEW OF HP LAPTOP 15-DY5024NR\\n---------------------------------------------\\nThis laptop is a bit disappointing for the price at time of review ($624). I was excited for the new generation of intel processors. So much power, even in the lower end processors. Unfortunately, processing power only gets you so far when multitasking on Windows. RAM is also a big deal if you want to multitask (like having multiple internet browser windows and a few other applications open at the same time)\\n\\nSo, to sum things up, here are my lists of pros and cons for this laptop.\\n\\nPROS\\n++ Has WiFi 6, which is currently the top standard for consumer WiFi\\n++ 12th gen i5 processor has plenty of power for big chores\\n\\nCONS\\n-- ONLY 8GB? Windows itself takes up about 4.4gb (~55%) without anything else running. Start adding applications and you will max out VERY fast. 8GB is simply not enough for basic computing in 2022.\\n-- Cannot upgrade RAM. Internals are not user serviceable. So, even if you wanted to upgrade, you would be risking your warranty. The back cover requires some surgery to remove!\\n-- Typical HP bloatware. Most of it you can just uninstall, but it is annoying that they still include all the advertising and bloatware out of the box.\\n-- Substandard screen. Lots of light bleed on the edges. Only 1080p and not touchscreen.\\n-- Not able to be powered through USB-C. This should be a no brainer for companies nowadays.\\n-- Overall feel is cheap. Touchpad, keyboard, casing, all of it just feels cheap.\\n\\nOverall, I would not recommend this laptop unless you are only using it to browse the internet and check email. If that is all you need it for, then this might be a decent option. However, even then, at this price point, there are many other options out there to discover and research. I will tell you right now that I did a search for similar specs but with 16GB of RAM and came up with several other options that were equal or LOWER price than this.\\n\\nBottom line, if you do anything other than email and internet browsing, this laptop is NOT for you. The Good: Light to carry, easy to set up.\\n\\nThe Bad: The 8GB RAM that you cannot upgrade limits how useful this is for me. It\\'s fine for some light web surfing and the occasional video, but anything more than that drains the battery very fast. I can\\'t use it for any of my work because multi-tasking on this just does the same - not really designed to handle anything too taxing on the RAM.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line: It\\'s a middle of the road for me. For entry-level laptop, It\\'s ok for very light web surfing and basic functions but the limitations with the RAM make this hard to use for any heavy duty multi-tasking that I would need for work. Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows.\\n\\nThe I5 processor is surprisingly good. Averaging only a 4٪ decrease in performance against the I7 model.\\n\\nNot suitable for gaming IMO. But I would recommend to most pc users. Power users will know this is not what they are looking for.\\n\\nFor price- it\\'s a fabulous deal The C - unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller. I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for $900. It had instability: frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior. After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem (they convinced me not to return it), I had to leave the country for several months. The problem persisted. At some point, HP installed Win 11 surreptitiously. This stopped my microsoft programs from working (I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win10 and do not work in win11). I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support. They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows 11 to win 10 at no charge. I did not accept. In June, just before the warranty expired, I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months. I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise. This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess. This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business (the first was in 2007, and I gave them a second chance). HP is both inept and dishonest. Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov 29th. Box was never opened until Christmas morning. Wife was thrilled. Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the 30th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection. I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead. I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken. The laptop has no ethernet ports. Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed. The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 MT7921 (2x2) and Bluetooth® 5.2 combo (Supporting Gigabit data rate) internal chipset. I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn\\'t connect. I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning. After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network. As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point.\\nThere\\'s a lot to like about this laptop (excellent processor, good amount of ram, so-so SSD storage) but a lot to dislike about it also. No up-gradable storage or ram, no backlit keyboard, gray on silver lettering on the keyboard, no removable/swap-able battery (it\\'s internal).\\nI have used HP products for 25 years and had my fair shape of issues with them but they have generally proven reliable. This is the poorest implementation of a $540 laptop I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s going back to Amazon for a full refund. I have seen others with the same issues on HP\\'s support site and it\\'s a relatively new laptop. What a waste of money, time and effort. HP, if your going to integrate everything in a throwaway design at least make it reliable for few years. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this for anyone. I was lucky (if you can call it that), mine failed within a week of ownership. Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available. The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over. This is my 3rd HP laptop and my first windows 11 pc. I bought it to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 HP Stream that I have kept up to date. I will be using this mostly for web browsing and streaming video and can truly say I\\'m amazed by just how much faster this is. Video and sound quality is excellent and web pages load instantly. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new laptop for personal use. I bought this laptop for my husband for his 65th birthday. His laptop was 11 years old and was on it’s last leg. He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past 11 years but this one is perfect! The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers. He plays word games and does puzzles, explores websites, he emails,,spends time on Facebook, checks out his sports, neighborhood stuff, etc… and if he wants to explore more, he can. It’s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease.\\nIt’s perfect and the price was SO right!! Oh, I also purchased the insurance plan just in case. That too is a great deal and great idea, in my opinion!\\n5 Stars! I am more than pleased with how easy it was transferring my files/photos, etc from my old laptop to this one. Being a senior, I am limited at times dealing with \"technology\" and since I keep all my records in a \"vault\" recovery of those files was critical for retaining my medical, financial, photo\\'s, etc it was important not to lose them. My old laptop had zero memory available, but I was able to \"link\" the use of both laptops and transfer my files with little effort at all. Very happy with this purchase Ignore the bad reviews this is a very good laptop . I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a new laptop! Update: It got stuck 3 more times and won\\'t connect to the wifi unless it is shut down, will be returning unfortunately.\\n\\nI bought this computer to replace a Toshiba laptop I\\'ve had for years and is now dying on me. I do like this computer, and I\\'ve only had one issue so far. It got hung up and I had to shut it down and restart it to be able to reconnect to the wi-fi. Other than that it has been great. It\\'s fast and lightweight. I use it primarily for note taking, journaling, and household tracking (such as finances) through word and excel and for those reasons I love it. The camera is better than my old laptop but nothing stellar. I have not tried to stream video or used sound yet so I can\\'t comment on that. Overall happy with my purchase so far, as long as it doesn\\'t have the issue with the wi-fi again. Wife uses this for work and has done well so far waited a little bit before review to see how it would be and has been great! Battery has been solid screen great and easy to use easy set up light weight and durable to an extent feels a little flimsy but it’s a slim laptop shipping was fast great product so far !!! Bought this over a year ago and love it. Just bought a second one for my father and he’s happy too. Great price great machine and it’s lightning fast. I use it mostly for work so Microsoft a office products. Some tv streaming. My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition! I mostly use it for work, but have used it for some older games and it works well. I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers. After 2, 3 days trading with amazon.com, it\\'s symbol showed up on the 1st app web page. I realized that this is built with an advanced AI system. Amazon has been collecting data concerning my buying habit for many years, and it suggesting this and that beforehand. But it will never be like human, because human mind is many hued animal. All around its a good laptop. Its fast and reliable. However... there is nearly zero gaming potential. This thing only has 0.13 go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go. Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem. With all that said everything else is great.👍 Very fast and efficient; responds well when scrolling down, and back to top; so far it is an excellent Laptop! Does what I need and for a great price from the Treasure Truck Very good screen quality. Easy set-up. SSD is great. I am more than pleased with my new laptop. It was more than I expected in a laptop Is fast, and it was a great value for the money. This is a great laptop! I love it!! Start up was fast. Everything is fast on this laptop. Buy this one! You won\\'t regret it. Great laptop for price Very nice laptop. It does what I need and was easy to get started with. It\\'s very good, the laptop works well, and it kept well, the only problem was the time taken to arrive, more than a month, the problem not from the seller but the company that you send the order in my country. thanks amazon! I love the size. It has everything I wanted except a touch screen which isn\\'t important now that my granddaughter is older. The speed is great and it has a 10 key which I hadn\\'t noticed until I received it. Great price for all the features Got this for my 17 year old son for school. It works great, fast, picture is SUPER clear, speakers were awesome. It was an excellent price for everything that comes in this laptop. Perfect for my needs. Got as a \"deal\"... great value. Would definitely buy again. Works perfectly, love it. Beautiful hp Laptop, quick delivery GREAT price. The laptop is as good as it is, nice and shine, brand new, config is fair relative to its price.\\nwow, if I\\'d been a little more patient and wait till the BF sales, with the same price I could get a more advance model of the same series with fingerprint reader and double SSD space... well, not bad anyways i bought this because i work from home. it was very easy to set up, it runs well, good cpu speed for multitasking, nice keys, nice screen, and surprisingly good speakers. the biggest problem i have is the battery life. it\\'s advertised as an average 8.15 hours but i started working 3.5 hours ago with 100% battery life and with battery saver on and performance settings chosen by windows, i\\'m sitting at 28%. wtf but if i choose best performance but then the text will be difficult to read and everything will just look horrible\\n\\nalso, there\\'s not light indicator for the num lock button, as there is for mute, caps lock and power, so when you pressing numbers on the right, if you inadvertently press num lock, you\\'re not typing anything. that can get annoying No touch screen, no sd card reader, no back-lit keyboard, no cd. Replacement for my other HP 17 that crashed. This seems \"smaller\" though dame size screen. I should have paid more attention when ordering and should have more due diligence.😎 Keeping it, but lesson learned. I bought a sd card reader and usb light for keyboard. works great really needed this . 1....This seems to be a good computer, fairly reasonably priced, very light and thin. Fast.\\n2.....I\\'m not sure yet about the battery. I\\'ve had one incident in which the notice came on that the battery was low. Usually, I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery. This is the second one, the first had a problem and had to be returned. There was some confusion with HP and Amazon, but Amazon came through for us. However, the return wasn\\'t as smooth as most Amazon returns, possibly because it was a computer. It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don\\'t shop at.\\n3... The silver keyboard is attractive but makes it hard to see. This could be fixed by making the letters thicker, therefore darker.\\n\\nIt is, all in all, a good machine. Thus replaced my desk top!! For $495 I took for my office really good laptop. For the price this is a great laptop! It\\'s fast and responsive! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! I need hot spot but it works really well. I love the computer. This works wonderfully for what I need it for! It responds very fast, and the pictures are sharp and clear. The solid state memory has been a pleasant surprise, as it\\'s the first of its kind I have owned. The wide screen allows me to work with multiple windows making drag and drop easy. The only thing that annoys me is that you need to use the Fn key to access F keys. I like the laptop but the description is wrong on the site no back lit keyboard no finger touch log on .. it’s working fine but false advertising as it’s best it’s like the reviews are for all the laptops like this model because it says on thing in the description only to not have it when it shows up Laptop operates at a good speed and is reliable. Everything is fine accept for the fact that it doesn’t have a backlit keyboard as advertised. I will be contacting Amazon. Love it! It was represented as a gaming laptop. It\\'s far from that but it is what it is The speed of the laptop is very good, I have it with Windows 11, it runs programs like photoshop and illustrator very well, in the gaming part I would give it an 8 out of 10, gears 5 does not run very well, I have made several configurations but it closes, other games like Dragon Ball FighterZ run very well. On the hardware side, it would have been more convenient to have the power button at one of the two ends and not near the delete button, in general it is a very good computer, for work issues it is very good. I have not yet investigated whether it works with windows hello, at the moment it only lets me log in with a PIN, it does not have a fingerprint option. I bought this product to replace my old 1737 Dell Studio Laptop so I can work from home and perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\\nI was a Dell fan for many years and at first was hesitant to buy this HP Laptop, but ultimately decided to go for ir since it offered me a brand new machine with the screen size that I was used to, the latest software and processor generation available and more importantly a solid state drive. At this price I could only get older, used or refurbished laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer.\\nI waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I\\'m glad I waited and found this one for under $700.\\nI\\'ve been using this laptop for over 2 months now and I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything looks and works great, fast startup and shutdown and it doesn\\'t get hot after many hours of continuous use.\\nI bought a USB splitter and a lamp that I can place right over the keyboard and the lack of multiple USB ports and a back-lit keyboard was solved!!! The screen is great. But it arrived with nothing to plug it in for charging. I had to find one from an old computer. There is no touch screen or back up light. It\\'s a good tool Very good Like screen size and speed. Great value Value for the money!\\nLight weight Easy to use, windows 11 is set up a lot different than 10 Love this computer! Ease of use and extremely fast! Very nice laptop. Will do everything I need it to do. Seems to work well with what I use it for but would have liked a built in disc drive and SD card slots. I\\'ve had this laptop for about almost 4 months. Everything was going great until two nights ago when the laptop began to glitch. The cursor is blinking overtime. I have an extension mouse as well and I have to use that one in order to get to what I am trying to open. The amount of money $650 for this item and it\\'s clutching. I bought this for my business. I figured I wouldn\\'t have to purchase a new one for a while. However, this is not good. very good computer I have had a 17 inch HP for about a decade and was shamed into updating since it was running Windows 8. That and I had loaded it down to the point it as sloooww. Bought this newer version and very happy. Not getting laughed at which is worth the price of admission. This is not a touch screen. I’ve had it less than a week but so far all seems to be really good. No complaints! I am very happy with the laptop. It has been a struggle with learning windows 11. I have only had this laptop for a week.\\nThe start up is quick I was pleasantly surprised how fast it is and how quick it handles a lot of things at once.\\nWould highly recommend! This product is for home use. It\\'s easy to hook up and has great features. Delivery was earlier than projected which was a plus. A great computer and all I hoped for. I love this laptop...It works great and has been a great addition to my home office. I bought this product for college and I paid the amount which is really expensive. I finally got it and I was so happy to get my new computer but it didn’t even come with windows. I paid $520 dollars for a useless computer then I need to pay $200 more just to get windows. No thank you. I sent it back and am waiting for a refund. Very fast processing speed. Great graphics. This is a nice little \"utility computer\", seems to have everything I need (no touch screen, but knew that ahead of time). BUT.... HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way. The forward facing camera, while it appears to work just fine, it is NOT an \"IR\" camera and therefore, Windows can NOT log you in using the camera. So for the next 2-3 years, every time I want to boot this laptop and use it, I\\'ll be typing in passwords and/or PIN\\'s. Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP\\'s literature. Seems a bit twisted to come pre-installed with Windows-11, but then due to a cheap, made in china camera, Windows \"Hello Face\" feature is completely unsupported. Would NOT buy this product again. Ever. This is my 3rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this... A usable cam would not have cost them $5 more. And then to not be up front about this and kind of \"hide\" this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least. Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using. Makes me wonder where else in their selection of hardware that they got equally CHEAP with to save a few pennies. This actually has no touch screen, so cannot rate that part. It is a good, fast laptop, and has good battery life Sold as having a backlit keyboard and it doesn\\'t. Overall operation is great. But wish the keyboard lite up!! This is a misrepresentation of the product. If I knew this, would not have bought it!!! Its twice as fast as my other computer . It has HD,lots of storage Nice size screen fast does everything I need This laptop is my personal computer. It\\'s so fast, easy to read due to the large screen, & love the feel of the keyboard. I love everything about it! Was easy to set up with no problems. One of the best Laptop computers I have ever bought. Picture quality is great So far so good I purchased this laptop for a tech bootcamp and while I was excited to get it and am in love with the size, the specs are different from what I got.\\n\\nThere isn’t a backlit keyboard, it doesn’t have windows 11, and the internet keeps dropping while I’m in class, etc.\\n\\nI contacted the seller and they immediately sent me shipping info for a return. I decided not to since I can update to Windows 11 myself, and then that’s when the wifi started dropping, randomly. Amazon won’t give me an option to talk to one of their reps and the seller is…\\n\\nIn my opinion, find a better deal with less hassle. Love it this is my first laptop Great price. Exactly as described I like this computer easy to find and type numbers and letters Bought this for myself and it was fine for about six months, then the fan went out. Right after buying it for myself, I bought one for my mom. Hers came straight out of the box with a fan problem and had to be returned to Amazon for a replacement. With two instances of buying this laptop, I’ve had two fan malfunctions way before I should have expected any issues. Seems to be a common problem. Fast and easy to use. I liked it very good Nice laptop. Convenient, fast, and nice experience with Windows 11.\\nBut the battery life is poor.\\nWith a battery charged 100% the battery is exhausted in about 7 hours. For routine daily use you pretty much have to leave the laptop plugged into the charger.\\n\\nI previously wrote the above review. I must change it. I consider this laptop to be a REAL LEMON. STAY AWAY. While recognizing that Windows 11 is yet another Microsoft upgrade, it must be loaded with undocumented features, i.e. bugs. Seems that anything you try to do invariably brings up an offer for product purchase or requires a password. Willing to battle through for the sake of trying a new IOS the fun started to increase exponentially when I tried to install HP Smart to use my all in one HP ENVY 6400 printer. There is absolutely NO ACCESSIBLE HP support. Everything you try leads to an offer to \"Chat\" with the HP Smart Agent. All you can do there is respond to questions it asks. When none of the questions apply to your problem, DEAD END. Mostly Amazon shows, facebook Nice sleek\\nLong lasting battery A great replacement Bought this laptop so I would work abroad for 5 weeks. For few days before trip, worked fine. Morning I am leaving, at airport, it crashes. I could not even get to log in screen. Kept receiving error messages. So, I get to Greece and spend 2 days running around to stores to fix it. Returning this piece of junk as soon as I get back to the US. It\\'s wonderful. I did not discover that I could not install programs such as Google chrome or other independent programs or my church or local companies that I order items from. Is there any way I can oder another more expensive laptop. I have only used thjis for primarily to read some issues of oour newspaper that are not printed on sATURDAYS The battery does not hold charge. Fully charged battery lost 20% after 30 minutes from unplugging. The bottom of laptop gets really hot. I would not recommend. Will return due to the incredible amount of heat that it puts out. Excessive heat shortens the life of electronics. For the cost, I expected better. Great laptop for the price. My 256ssd/8gb boots up in seconds. My 6 year old Pavillion took 5 minutes on a good day. Slim and light weight. The back lit keys are a pleasant surprise. Battery life is slightly better than my old laptop but nothing to write home about. Also no sd slot. WHY?? only thing missing is a CD Drive\\nEVERYTHING WORKS WELL\\nGreat Laptop ; you get what you pay for This laptop is great for getting clerical work or simple tasks such as web based business or office products completed. I\\'d say the only real drawback is the screen quality. It looks rather washed out, but otherwise it works great for what I need it to do. Great for work, good for watching videos, and naturally, bad for video games with the exception simple pixel or old indie games. It also doesn\\'t have a SD card reader built in, but you can get a usb adaptar for that. If you are going to process a lot of data at one time, such as large databases or many browser windows, I suggest upgrading the RAM to 12 or 16GB as the 8GB it comes with gets eaten up quickly. It is a simple and inexpensive upgrade and HP made accessing it easy. Just watch out for the hidden screws under the rubber grips. I was thrilled to find this computer for our homeschool family. It is working great. I love my hp lap top. It is not a touch screen.\\nTook a little getting use\\nTo windows 11 but I love it now. Worth the money. Use it a lot for home use. Not business. Nice laptop for school. Easy to use. Very fast. Good storage. Lightweight. Love the big screen. It’s a great laptop for the price and space. Perfect Great Easy to set up! Dependable product. I am using this to replace my old laptop at. Home. This one is so much faster to boot up and perform any activity. I had my friend help me pick it out because he\\'s good at this kind of stuff. I\\'ve had the computer now a few weeks and I\\'m well pleased with it. The only thing I wished is that the screen was brighter and they should make the power button stand out more than the rest of the keys. It\\'s a little hard to find. Next time I think I would like to get one where the keys light up. But overall I think it\\'s a lot of computer for the money. So far just a month with it. But the large 17\" screen, the processing speed i love. Light up keyboard would have been a great idea though seeing that I use this mostly at nights when i\\'m home. However, no complaints. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Respect from Jamaica. This came with Windows 10 S which seems fairly secure. I have already upgraded to Windows 11 S.\\nYou can download apps only from the Microsoft store which is a disappointment. The app store is very limited so you\\'ll probably find that your favorite apps aren\\'t there and cannot be loaded on your machine.\\nApps like Google Earth Pro, Google Earth, banking and financial apps cannot be loaded. You can remove the S but then you cannot put it back. Okay, so normally not a big believer in brand new, basic laptops. Like cars, I would prefer to buy a higher spec laptop that is a few years old for the same amount of money. However, when this came up on Prime Day as a flash sale for Prime members, I threw caution to the wind and recklessly spent my hard earned money on something that inflation had not yet seem to hit!\\n\\nUnpacking: Packaged like a refurb. Generic cardboard box with plastic wrapped laptop in foam holders, the AC adapter and two pieces of written documentation. That\\'s it. No pretty outer box with all the specs, fancy pictures of even color. Though it looked like a refurb package, unit was in fact brand new. They didn\\'t waste money on fancy packaging, which let\\'s be honest, you don\\'t need anyway.\\n\\nFirst Impressions: This thing is BIG. A 17\" screen with 3/4\" bezels on all sides is hard to imagine until you are holding it. Small, svelte and built for the road warrior this thing is not!\\n\\nBuild quality: Okay, here is where the budget starts to shine through. The entire case looks like beautiful brushed aluminum...until you feel it. There is no mistaking this, it is the thinnest plastic that would hold the finish and provide a wet noodles worth of structural integrity. There is greater than expected flex to the chassis, the joints where the plastic panels meet feels like an old \"snap tite\" model and you just know that scratches and wear are going to be apparent in short order. I am now searching for a case, if they even make them for this as it appears to be a new model. This is a laptop that will feel more at home being a desktop replacement than your sidekick on roadtrips.\\n\\nPorts/Access: The box says seven ports, which is par for the course, but the composition of them again points to a budget price point. Standard USB, check. HDMI, check. Card reader, check. USB-C, nope. Separate headphone and microphone jacks, nope. And oh my, when was the last time you saw a wired ethernet port with the expandable \"jaw\" that opens to allow that massive plug? That is going back to pre wi-fi days. A USB-C and separate jacks for mic and audio would have been welcome in lieu of that wired ethernet jack. Again, though, this is a budget laptop and I will not fault the omissions at this price point. On that note, when I opened the laptop, I was pleasantly surprised by what appeared to be a fingerprint reader above the ESC key! Upon further examination, the \"reader\" turned out to be the physical power button and the only thing it will do with your finger is cycle up and down to turn the pc on and off. Also, in today\\'s age of USB-C options, it would have been nice to see the AC port use the USB-C interface instead of the proprietary \"blue tip\" adapter that HP has been using for generations now. I guess the good news is that if you have a blue tip or three laying around, you have plenty of spare adapters.\\n\\nFunction: Windows 11 boots right up and for those uninitiated to it, looks eerily similar to Apple\\'s OS series. The bottom task bar is now a \"dock\" and quick launch icons are centered in it now. With 4 GB of RAM, an 11th gen i3 processor and onboard video being handled by Intel (and sharing in that massive 4 GB system RAM) this is not your gaming laptop. In fact, you may or may not realize that for the cost of a good graphics card today, you could easily buy two or three laptops like this for the price of a good GPU. Stick with Hearts, Solitaire and Minesweeper and you will be fine. I do not game, my work is office production and work related so I doubt I will tax the GPU and be very happy with what I find. Overall, the laptop feels quick as expected for ordinary tasks, web surfing and production apps.\\n\\nSound: Like TV\\'s, the speakers are there for the most basic sound you can tolerate. If audio quality above the intense sound of an angry hornet in a tin can is what you crave, grab your headphones or external speakers and rock on.\\n\\nKeyboard: As is common today, \"chiclet\" keys with separate number pad to the right. For all of the real estate this size laptop creates, anything less than full size keys would be criminal (and comical in appearance). The keys have a nice feel to them. They are not cherry switches, but they do have tactile \"thumps\" when typing and don\\'t feel like you are typing on top of foam rubber. Something I have become very accustomed to and greatly miss is a lighted keyboard. Unless I just cannot figure out how to turn it on, which I doubt. Suspiciously, every function key has an alternate function (like brightness up/down, volume up/down, track skip, play, and even airplane mode) EXCEPT for f5 which has no alternate function whatsoever. This is the typical location for keyboard light so it appears to be MIA. Again, for the price, not going to complain, and given that this is more a desktop replacement than a road warrior, it should not impact most users anyway.\\n\\nNoise: You can always tell an older laptop by the amount of time the fans kick up in speed when using it. For most newer laptops, rarely do you hear the fans spool up as the hardware can handle most standard tasks. The older the hardware gets, the more it gets tasked by updated apps and requirements, the more the fans spool up to accommodate the higher energy draw and load. I have yet to hear anything but a whisper from this laptop.\\n\\nScreen: No, it is not a touch screen. Yes, the panel exhibits a lot of variation when viewed from any angle other than directly looking at it. I would say the direct zone is about 45 degrees total from left to right before you get very noticeable color and brightness variations. If more than one person is viewing (or you let your kids use it in the car) it is best used by at most, two people sitting very close.\\n\\nWrap Up: As with most anything in life, it is a balance of cost vs benefit. As I sit on this laptop and do this review, it is clear to me what HP focused on (and what they purposely left out) to provide a laptop at this price point. As a desktop replacement (complete with physical ethernet jack), this unit excels at a large display, a decently tactile keyboard, plenty of ports for common use, and sufficient hardware to meet the expectations of the production/surfing/simple web based gaming crowd. It will also please the occasional trip to the back porch for morning coffee while perusing your favorite blog. But start to travel a lot with this, putting it through the torture of soft sided cases, airport screeners or even just riding shotgun to and from work on a regular basis, it appears the chassis will quickly fall behind the performance of smaller display units or units made from actual brushed metal.\\n\\nI have another HP with a touch screen, metal case, double the memory and double the capacity SSD in it. If I factor price out of the equation, this laptop is less than satisfying. If I factor in the price and realize that the laptop I am comparing this one to is FOUR TIMES times more expensive, I am quite happy with the serviceability and performance of this! As with most things in life, you get what you pay for, and this is no exception. The HP PC and laptops are the BEST there is and it LASTS for a REALLY long time. I took mine from high school and used through my time at the university through my doctorate. You guessed it, THIS is my second one!!! I could have fainted when I saw the price and bought this baby ASAP. You actually would have to slam it into a wall to break it. It\\'s an excellent choice for school, personal or business use. The support is phenomenal.\\nWhen I think of HP what comes to mind is High Performance tech! You can NEVER go wrong with HP\\'s! I Love This Laptop! I have no problems with it at all. The size is everything and the speed is an absolute PLUS! I am satisfied with the laptop! I got this laptop on Amazon days in October. It was a great price and I needed to replace a 10 year old laptop.\\nOne BIG DRAWBACK!! The keyboard does NOT LIGHT UP! I didn\\'t think they made laptops with unlit keyboards. That severely limits where you can use it. I went through the complete ad and found no mention of the unlit board. I like the product everything is in excellent working order beautiful screen and the price doesn\\'t hurt your pocket Liked size and look did not like the keys are same as color of unit very hard to read needed to be darker Simple, fast, reliable and affordable.\\nWould recommend to anyone. I am very pleased with this laptop! BUY IT! Everythings Fine. Much faster than previous, wis it had more USB ports Great laptop Screen quality is good. Great product great seller would recommend Laptop is very quiet. CPU speed is great. Got this for my husband...aka early Christmas gift. He works hard and has had issues with his other used laptop. He is most pleased! It\\'s a very nice laptop for the money He says there is no such thing as a perfect laptop so he wouldnt give it all five stars. He didnt even know there was a touch screen. The laptop itself is fine. I bought it because I couldn\\'t update my old laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 11. If I had known then what I know now I would\\'ve taken my chances on keeping Windows 7. Windows 11 is such an intrusive, cluttered, jump through the hoops mess that I hardly use the new laptop. Great price good investment So far I love the laptop. It\\'s bigger than I thought so I will definitely need a larger table for it. It\\'s easy to use and connect. One of my favorite purchases. I was looking for a simple computer and this is perfect for that. However, it is heavy. it does the job, it worth for the money. this new laptop i got is excellent and very good value for the price Poor contrast with keyboard keys. Poor design by HP, I would say! Lots of people do not have excellent vision! White on black would have been much better, as shown on my hand held calculator. Getting accustomed to Windows 11 is another story, for a later time! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Great screen size and full keyboard...but the disk kept failing despite updating drivers. Also lost connectivity to the USB ports. Returned after three weeks of use. A great laptop well please.. I love this laptop because it is so fast and not too difficult for a lady who is 70 and not very computer savvy.\\nI also have an HP printer. I use this basically for personal stuff. The first thing I noticed when it was delivered is that the laptop is HUGE! I was disappointed because I thought it was a touch screen and I thought it would have lighted keys but it didn\\'t have either! It has a great looking screen display but the speakers are weak and the battery doesn\\'t last long at all. I wouldn\\'t recommend this computer. I purchased this HP especially for the size of the screen and this brand because my previous one was a HP,\\nand easy to use and the features.\\n\\na For $299 a great buy. Even has Solid State drive. I rarely ever use my computer anymore. I forgot to update to win11 so instead of buying it, just buy new. My old Lenovo (2016) was very slow. I swear they program it to slow down after 5 years. Have been very happy with this computer. Works great so far. Will say at least for what I expect from a computer. I love the size of the screen! Makes it great for work. Have had no issues. opened and up and running in ten min. Nice for the price!!!! One of the best electronic buys I’ve made in a long time. The size is great the style is great and the screen quality is so vivid I was so excited when this laptop arrived today - it was delivered undamaged, it was updated already with Windows 11 & it was so easy to set up! Thank you!!! It\\'s incredibly fast, and the 17 inch screen is a joy! Nice laptop, works great. I work in IT and I have no issues. Its just really big (thats my fault). I love the number keypad. I’m going to need help with using the laptop. The new generation is good at figuring it out. I’m old school and don’t even know where to start. I’m going to need help I’m 68 and the new technology is not working out for me. Buy the computer for the office. Does the job, works fine. And it has a good screen. Works fine Half of what it cost about 3 years ago! Great computer, comes with MS word package. Big screen. Great sound speakers. Very happy! Wish it was a bit smaller but all in all I\\'m much happier than the Chromebook I bought the year before. Very fast, long battery life. The HD camera is great for streaming Huge screen, Good quality. Perfect condition and as described Excellent product Decent laptop to do basic stuff, not a good option for gaming or graphics. Good for email, basic internet browsing and some streaming. Easy to use. Good size Happy so far with no complaints!! Great investment I mainly use this computer for working at home and some internet browsing. It is much faster than the laptop with an i5 processor and twice the ram than it replaced. For general tasks that aren\\'t too demanding it is a good affordable option. It is a nice laptop. The quality is good. But it is not cheap. This is a really nice laptop Windows 11 not as friendly to users as 8 or 10.\\nThis unit has intermittent ethernet port causing really strange problems. WiFi works fine. I have had the laptop for less than 2 months, and it does not work well at all:\\n\\n1) It will routinely disconnect from Wifi, even when I am in the same room as the router.\\n2) I try to link my airpods to it using Bluetooth, and they won\\'t stay connected, even though these airpods can connect to my work computer and my phone very easily without any problems.\\n3) Every so often, when I turn the computer on, I get a message saying that a heating fan is not spinning and that I would have to try turning on the computer later.\\n\\nI like saving money, and I don\\'t need anything beyond the basics in a laptop... but I would like a computer that can turn on, stay connected to the internet, and allow Bluetooth pairing without causing me consistent problems.\\n\\nDo not buy this product. I get this laptop as a gift and it died after 5 months. The screen is completely black and can not turn back on. It only works if I plug it into the tv with a hdmi which defeats the whole point of a laptop. I updated the drivers but no change. Wow! No backlit keyboard and that is NOT disclosed on the product page!!!!\\nCant see the keys! Bought a monitor light bar. Far better! Screen is not lit well and the vibrance is terrible! Works fine but the casing is defective and already falling apart. Now the laptop cannot be closed. HP technical support offered to have it shipped back for repairs and said they would return it within 7 to 9 business days. Who can be without their laptop for 2 weeks? My son can’t because he’s taking online colleges classes. Beware of Amazon Lightning deals. You get what you pay for. Product won\\'t boot up, less then 4 months old and already have problems. Amazon was of no help whatsoever, very dissatisfied. I did notike the fact that right in the middle of reading the news, a porn sight popped up and my computer was locked down so I am returning it asap! This is my second Chromebook\\nMy previous was cellular connect but sadly die on me and couldn’t find another one.\\nBut this is perfect for me not only is super fast the both time is on seconds only the performance is great\\nI do everything on this, light weight and easy to carry is excellent to take on the road\\nAnd the battery life is good several hours before die\\nNo touch scream on this model but I don’t feel the need to use that option.\\nThe trackpad is very response and the screen definition full HD is great\\nOverall I do recommend this product for catching up with your favorites website movies Netflix etc\\nAlmost forgot I got this one for the game play steam and I wasn’t disappointed it handles well those games\\nSadly the steam service is going to be shut down next year but nevertheless it performs as advertised. We just needed something simple as we did not have our businesses anymore. This is very lightweight and easy to carry around and thin also. It does not have a delete button though, and that is the one thing we did not like. We love it in general though. Happy with purchase, Laptop is in Great Condition & looks brand new. The only thing I wasn’t aware of, is that I would have to load Chrome Recovery Utility on to a USB using another Computer to get it to start up. But besides that everything is good. This is an excellent little Chromebook, and I probably should know this, but you might want to mention that it is not Windows compatible!! Needed a cheap but good laptop for work so I grabbed this hp chrome book and it\\'s been very useful so far. Fast start up good battery life. It\\'s very capable of doing everything I need so far. this HP 2020 Flagship 14 Chromebook Laptop Computer 14-inch HD is Excellent perfect condition\\nEsta laptop es excelente, trabaja, perfecto. i like it so much i purchase 2 This chromebook laptop is great for what it costs. The price-tag reflects the chromebook\\'s natural lack of sophisticated abilities, but this laptop is great for students on the go. The battery life is conducive to a faster-paced schedule and lasts well into the day without a charge. Easily customizable, this computer is well worth its price. I\\'ve only had it for 1 month but, the tablet was super easy to set up, the keyboard is easy to use, and super fast response! The battery life is superb. I use it for emails, web surfing and its surprisingly good for watching movies ,TV and listening to music. The Bluetooth is a big plus for me I use my earbuds and Bluetooth speaker. So far so good! I recommend virus protection! It definitely is worth the MONEY! It runs apps, and can use Linux although that takes some setting up. had to watch some videos to see what i could install. overall a stable decent laptop for under 200 bucks. dont expect to play games on it though. i use it mostly for web browsing and email. Good for what I need it for but does have a habit of blacking out when in the middle of something. Not sure why it does that. I have had other Chromebooks that did the same thing. Love it😍😍 If I already put a comment on this before my opinion hasn\\'t changed any. I bought a refurbished one, but the company said it was new -- whatever -- it was in excellent condition. I had no complaints on that!\\n\\nIt works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department. I might have wished for USB ports -- but so far I have no reason to use them.\\n\\nApparently, this true of --any-- HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard, and it wiii be a bear to replace! I hope it has a very long life!\\n\\nI got it at a good price, the in-house Linux was easy to set up, that\\'s one very important reason the 64 GB disk space was important to me, so I have no problem recommending this Chromebook. Overall, after I figured out how to get the touch pad activated, I found it to be a really good PC. It was very nice looking the screen was large and clear. And was very light Weight. I purchased this as I needed a light simple laptop to take with me when I travel. I didnt need anything super fast or high dollar as I use my custom built desktop for that. I ordered this knowing it was able to be returned. I was surprised and very happy with what I got. Package was well packed. Simple. Laptop and charging cable. I charged it for a few hours and setup was a breeze. Computer is nice, light, and works well. The chrome OS is a little harder to setup and get where you want but its something you can GOOGLE!!\\n\\nIf there is ANYTHING I can gripe about it is this. The keyboard is in lower case and I doint like that. Thats it!! Battery life is great and super light weight Sleek and cost effective I purchased this laptop for school work, singing, and podcasting. I love it, and give it a big ups 💯💻 This is a great laptop for the price however it\\'s not touchscreen it\\'s very light weight and easy for Travel . purchased this chromebook in Sept. of last year. it came boxed with a notice inside saying they upgraded the resolution to a higher definition than originally suppose to have come with and boy did it show. I\\'m am a true believer in a chromebook. it\\'s fast. easy to use and can do almost everything my hp windows laptop use to do. the upgrades are fast and it notifies you when upgrade is available and all one needs to do is press the restart button and that\\'s it. I get my internet thru my lan line phone co. which also provides a top notch anitvirus. luv everything about this laptop. My MacBook was giving me a hard time so I needed a new laptop fast for work that was cheap. This exceeded my expectations! Overall I love this computer. If you\\'re in need of a low budget laptop this is the product you want. It\\'s under $200 and you can not beat it . You don\\'t have to download/pay for Microsoft Word it comes with its own. I love it I really do. Thank You I decided to purchase this laptop after my desktop computer was annihilated from a windows update. My desktop is currently up and running again although it\\'s running slow, so I figured having a backup of some sort where I can access important documents and whatnot is smart in case of emergencies (i.e. work or school). It\\'s hard to believe this is a refurbished laptop because it runs so smoothly. Definitely a worthy purchase so far! really like this affordable refurbished guy. i take it every where with me instead of my 5 lb laptop. take it in the hot tub and in the pool really great. great key board great screen. maybe one less point for the track pad but still good. great internet. fast and ready to go as soon as you open the puppy up. 0 problems 1 week in knock on wood. gooooood. This does everything I need it to do and was really inexpensive so I was a little skeptical on what type of product I was getting. I normally buy Apple products but needed something quick on a low budget and this is perfect. It\\'s great but for Google only Lightweight. Great size. I\\'ve been using for awhile now and no issues. I\\'m happy with this purchase. Product showed up on time. Looks like brand new. Love the device The unitmarrived quickly. Took it out of the box, and the first thing i noticed was it was very dirty; the underside was covered in handprints and fingerprints. Also noticed that it was not the same unit that was advertised. One feature listed was a micro sd reade, and this unit did nit have it. The last item was it would not connect to a wifi network. I did every diagnostic possible to inckude restting the device, the router, znd the modem, and it would not accept the router key. Every device i own is either refurbished or renewed, and this was the first one i had any issues with. Since tech support and other common-sense troubleshooting items couldnt fix it, i sent it back. Wanted to replace a very old MacBook used for browsing while watching TV etc. Didn\\'t need anything high end obviously. Just something to online shop, pay a few bills, and watch YouTube.\\n\\nPurchased the Chromebook without a lot of research. Mostly price and reviews. After several months of use there aren\\'t any negatives other than a dead pixel or two. Impressed with overall speed and ease of use.\\n\\nWould purchase again. This was a gift; I can\\'t rate it, but my granddaughter is very happy with it. I love how fast it is and how clear the images are and the battery life is long enough to not have to charge it constantly, but when I do charge it it does so fast. I got it for personal use and future school work so it’s exactly what I was looking for Was honestly expecting a unit with dings or scratches or looking refurbished. The only way you know it is refurbished is because it does not come in original packaging. VERY happy with this purchase so far. Would recommend to others! Excellent quality of material.. Super durable battery.. Very easy to use, I am totally satisfied with my purchase, I do not regret having done it... 🥰🥰🥰 I needed a cheaper laptop just for school purposes. I wasn\\'t expecting too much based of the reviews for more than a regular work laptop. However, this laptop is downplayed. It can do a lot more and operates great. The only issue I have is the screen flickering when it\\'s about to die, but you can clearly tell why. This is not a touch screen. Easy setup, small and lightweight. I had to return it because it had only one USB port. Wow did this ever get here fast? Impressive speedy shipping and delivery. Very satisfied with the product so far. I\\'ve only had it a day, so time will tell overall, on how well it runs. Thank you. This laptop is a great starter laptop! Its small and light weight. The picture is great. The battery lasts forever. Very happy with this purchase!! Not enough technical hardware, like CD player and extra USB connections. FAR to dependendent on the cloud for storage. Love loves it✨ Very productive at home and on the go 👌🏽✨😍 My kids needed them for school . These are great for the money. Good buy Light weight, seems to be pretty easy to use! Has a long battery life and completely charges in an hour or 2 I also like the fact it has a charging port on the left and right side of it! I am so happy that I took chance to make this purchase. It arrived quickly and in pristine condition. Workd great, saves the environment, as well and the need I have to have school on the go. I was skeptical to buy a laptop for such a low price, but I took the risk and bought it. I cannot express how glad I am that I went for it. It came in perfect condition and it blew me away! Its the best laptop ive owned thus far. Its easy to use, has beautiful screen quality, and very lightweight. Its perfect for not only school and work, but I can also play games on the google play store so ive had a lot of fun with that. Overall its sleek, speedy, and super easy to use. :) Our organizations didn\\'t have enough computers for everybody, so I purchased my own to leave at school. First, I received a really good looking machine. It made a seamless transition to every program I needed to get my work done. A battery charge lasts nearly the entire week. I feel I got a good value for the money. The chromebook itself is fine but the usb charger was bent. I did a chat w amazon and they said they were shipping me a charger but it has not arrived yet. I emailed the seller and they said to order another charger and they would refund me? No thanks. Sounds risky. Order the “new again” almost worked perfectly but if the seller would have taken a quick glance they would have seen the bent usb plug. Still no charger has arrived. Great chromebook though Needed a laptop for school, am happy I got it works perfectly, light to carry around Good times It\\'s really good for anything browser based, but physically cannot download most apps and programs, not even steam. Had no idea that chrome books are not compatible with most apple and window programs. If you want to have fun with a chrome book learn Linux. This Laptop only has ONE USB port, I repeat ONE. I run a small business and I need a USB port for printer and label printer so this doesn’t cut it, will return. However overall it’s a pretty good laptop. It is very nice. We can watch Netflix, videos, etc. You have to adjust the position in order to see a good image. My daughter couldn\\'t install the game she wanted to play. Sorry, don\\'t know why has to do something with the system. Great laptop when it worked; nice size and touch screen BUT battery stopped charging after 1 month of using it… purchased another charger but that didn’t make any difference This laptop is \"ok\" for the price but it has a few flaws. It does not have an HDMI port so you cannot use it for presentations. It only has 1 USB port so you cannot use a mouse and a jump drive or printer at the same time, all must be wireless. And the new style charger that is similar to a phone charger breaks easily. But if you just strictly need it to get online and do online schooling, it\\'s fine. this is the second h-p chromebook Iv\\'e had in the last five years. They are perfect for storage, transporting, and taking up very little space. Like the look and light weight. I use it at home for everything from internet to streaming movies , games and you tube. This refurbished chromebook has no noticeable difference from my original new chromebook. Was a refurbished unit but works and looks like new. Was a great price for as much as you get. Battery life is about 6-8 hours. Way above my expectations Lightweight, great battery life. For my son school clases Great product my son loves it!!! It really worked well for about two weeks. The money was quickly refunded and I purchased a different one and have had no problem with it. I needed a new computer to start college in the spring and was also on a budget. Refurbished was good way to go for me and definitely couldn\\'t beat the price. I purchased the non touchscreen version (I don\\'t see that to be a necessary feature) and I am very pleased with its performance, battery life, sleek design, and light weight. Highly recommend! Its a basic Chromebook. Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do. Internet searching, emails and can stream amazon video. Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also. For the money...I think it was a great purchase. All is good . We have no complaints I had to buy these for work in an emergency, they arrived early and saved a messy situation. The chrome books are in perfect shape, work superbly, and have long enough battery life for our needs. Plus they are full HD models, I wasn’t expecting that at this price point. I’d definitely get the same models from the same sellers again if needed. Everything about the computer is great but the touchpad is glitching and with think I’m clicking it when I’m not. The space bar will also freak out…I’ve tried a factory reset and doing research about the setting but nothing works. I don’t wanna waste my money on a mouse because you cant completely disable to touchpad :/ It’s definitely value for money.\\n64GB is good enough for daily usage.\\nIt is easy to use once you logged in. It is the first chrome-book that i have ever used. It’s easier than that i thought.\\nSize is good, light to carry and slim which makes it looks good. I didn’t activate touch screen yet, but seems like works good.\\nSatisfied. 😊 Great buy Love it It a good little laptop. Great price. Low storage was immediately upgraded. It came the next day no issues. It came charged. Set up was easy. You\\'d never know it was refurbished!! My pic is to give you an idea how big the screen is. Clear pictures. Runs fast. So happy with this buy!! I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it\\'s not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can\\'t do is a wireless connection to my printer. Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up. Love it and so easy to use\\nExcellent I had my older laptop for last 8 years and it come time to upgrade. I did a research, and with my needs of accomplish many tasks in browser, I decided to purchase a Chromebook. My order came without delay. Chrome operation system include a lot of useful android applications. I am very happy with my choice. It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed. Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen. Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use. Can\\'t beat the price for this level of computer. We bought this product for my father in law as a gift. He\\'s a novice to say the least at technology and couldn\\'t be more pleased with the product. Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place. I would definitely order from them again! I loved what a super light device it is perfect for the homeschooler or if you are passionate about working at home from social media. It\\'s super thin, you can carry it in your shopper-style bag wherever you go. It’s good for price and work I like everything about the Chrome. It is a very fast computer. There was no problem and i hookup to my wifi\\neasily. It’s great works good This computer arrived a couple of days late but looked brand new and was in perfect working order. It’s a great price, so glad we found it…. Part of the review criteria says touch screen? It’s not a touch screen though or if it is that option isn’t working? Very great Works ok. It is a used laptop. It sounds good. It works good. Only this is the Facebook APP crashes. But I can use the web browser for that and it feels better. Overall 5 stars. Great quality and worth the money. Really solid Chromebook for the price. This was the only laptop that was in my (very minimal) budget that was 4x64 instead of 4x32, so I was afraid it would last in other areas, but it\\'s still pretty speedy for the specs. Perfect for browsing and basic office work functions This is the perfect size for our kids to do school work, my husband to do his work. This is a great value, the screen is clear, lightweight computer, fast and easy to connect to wifi. Will be ordering more for my kids to do all their homeschool. Great Value There’s no touch screen features but it’s lightweight and good price It is so light and very easy to use. I am using it for work and it makes things so easy and fast to log in and get right to work. The screen is very clear and easy to see everything. It is great value for the money paid. Great value for the money, light weight, everything you need in one computer. Great for work or play. Fast start up and shut down. If you’re looking for a computer that is light weight and can do it all this is it. I would definitely buy this again. Definitely worth it! Got this little bad boy for my 8 year old to participate in her online schooling and she\\'s totally thriller. Ideal for her and it\\'s intended use and then some. If I didn\\'t purchase it myself I wouldn\\'t have known it was renewed. 1. Fast for Chrome OS. 2. Small size and light weight for 14 inch display. 3. Clear display quality. 4. Good sound of front pacing B&O speakers. 5. Long battery. 6. Good keyboard and touchpad. very good investment I loved it I have had this laptop since September 22, 2021 everything is perfect except for when I am using my laptop camera to make content it goes out randomly then come back up. Overall can mean my laptop is hacked possibly by the supplier or whomever. It is extremely nerve wracking simply because this is a refurbished product and you never know what type of creeps are watching you. Upon purchasing I will recommend getting it checked for bugs and making sure you’re not being watched. I was surprised how great this computer came out to be. My son uses it for homeschool. I definitely recommend it for as a student computer and to get the work done. Picture quality can be a little bit better and low memory it’s still great price for what I do with it I needed a new laptop for the upcoming semester and this one is exactly what I needed. It came in great condition and the speakers are amazing. Not to mention it is a great price. I purchased as a gift, I did not realize it was refurbished when I purchased. That being said, the overall computer works well for the purposes my husband needs it and he is enjoying it. My favorite about this new computer is that now I can play games with my friends online! It also helps me with my art projects for inspiration and stuff. Great value for the money, I was more than happy with the computer I received. It came in a very timely manner and was in good shape! very pleased, will definitely recommend. Great product 😀 Great laptop and came like new. Everything is working great after many weeks. I am impressed and recommend it! The packaging was very secured. The chromebook and charger feels and operate like new... i got it in a timely manner.. Do not hesitate to buy!! The HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop. It can be used for researching online, budgeting and finances, games, music and movies. Shopping for anything needed for the entire family.Taking classes on line or for homework for students. This is not a touchscreen chromebook. It served the purpose that I bought it for. For my son that will be attending high school. This is just the right size and weight. Came out the box looking and performing brand new. Very easy set up and downloads. Got it for some class work. Great value for the price. Would buy it again. Absolutely love this product, looks just like the picture. Comes in great packaging. Works well for personal use or work. Over all I loved it👍🏼 terms of service. apparently if u cant hit the agree to tos u r not gonna use the pc.\\ncouldnt load data.\\nfluke possibly but never chrome again. Everything is fine, except the touch pad seems a little bit cranky, but for its price, it is definitely worth it Equipment in excellent condition I would not know this was refurbished and pleasantly surprised. I am very happy with the purchase and price. Also, delivery was made in 3 days and packaging was tight. Very happy! Perfect for home schooling very nice computer. Light weight & beautiful clear screen. Great value & quality.\\nWould highly recommend.. Works perfectly. Lightweight and fast. If your wifi disconnects after you close your laptop turn sleep mode off so when it closes the wifi still stays connected. i love this product for its battery life OMG!!! I absolutely L O V E this computer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so easy to set up and so light weight. I am borderline OBSESSED I needed a Chromebook for work and bought this one. So surprised at how good it actually is. Money well spent! I love this computer. It is a great buy. It was very easy to set up. It a gift for me 10 year old. I love this computer. It is very nice. Works great for being a year old. It’s not a laptop. It’s basically a tablet with a keyboard. I read a bunch of reviews before buying but this model is older than the one I read about figuring it would all be relatively the same. It’s not. It’s a glorified tablet that MOST apps will not work on. I bought an external disc drive so I could load a program on to it but it’s not supported. That should be the chromebook slogan; This program is not supported. Should have paid for a real laptop. I am very pleased with this product. My son is a freshmen in college and this is perfect for him. I like it! The size is bigger than I thought. It was easy to set up. Perfect for what I need to do. The computer is small and light weight. It’s perfect for my college student to carry around campus and use in class. Very happy with this computer, delivery was fast, which I needed. I would highly recommend this product. It operates very well, the screen is so clear and bright and the sound system is loud.. its really a great buy! Works perfectly , battery holds for days . Like new Laptop is very good. Delivery was speedy. I can recommend this vendor totally Great computer I’ve been using for work!! Very lightweight Not a touch screen but a good laptop for the money. My kids love it. Performance is good for daily tasks.\\nPrice is very good with good design outlook. I love their it’s pretty good for to be the price it is❤️ I really like the lap top..serves my purpose in retrieving all the information I need Easy to set up and use right away. Charges very fast,. It is also lightweight and slim. Just like new money well spent EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT, COMES IN A VERY WELL PROTECTED BOX, ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY IN COLOMBIA, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. EXCELLENT SELLER I liked the size and weight of the laptop. It’s easy to carry and easy to move. Currently using product for school. Product is awesome. Satisfied customer!! While trying to input my password I noticed the E wasn’t working. After trying countless times, it simply would not work. Then after testing all the letters, I noticed the S and D also did not work. It’s obviously essential for all keys to work when using a laptop so this was extremely disappointing and I wouldn’t suggest you waste your money. Testing something so quick and essential such as the keyboard seems like a pretty logical thing to do before selling a refurbished product. It’s an external issue, should have been as easy fix and never released to be sold in such condition. Returning and purchasing with a different company. light weight. good value, easy to use. Setting it up is a breeze. Highly recommend. Looks brand new, acts brand new great pc at a great price Cheaply made and an inferior designed case Worked great was what I wanted and was a great deal for the price. The person using this only gets on the internet. That is exactly what we needed. Excellent quality price My daughter LOVED getting this for her bday. She uses it every day. TOUCHSCREEN DOESNT WORK, BATTERY LIFE OK This chromebook is awesome! It’s exactly what i was wanting. This was a replacement for my 6 year-old chromebook. Love it! Great laptop, definitely would buy again, it starts up speedy, no lags! I really was impressed with the quality and the ram storage Great great value for the money! Just what I wanted. Very well packaged, excellent screen quality. Not a single scratch, excellent condition of the product. I love this computer ! Great for the price. it really can not be used, without problems, Who does the refurbing anyway? The value for this laptop was all great spend on this Terrific, powerful and a great size! Good for work. Easy to use, good value Great little starter computer for my son in college! Works great This computer is great! So happy with this purchase. good value, chrome os is very fast Good quality. Light weight, very good for price Perfect condition and works beautifully. Fast shipping nice product easy setup Good product and very prompt!!! Excellent article This chrome book is fast and streams videos quickly. I like it! It’s good! Good quality product Great laptop for the money Nice and lightweight I\\'m really starting to question Amazons refurbished junk yard. The quality is exactly that JUNK, dont waste your money buying or even considering buying returned /refurbished junk, ITS NOT WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY, AND AMAZON DONT GIVE A FLYING HOOT. Even new products from Amazon are failing as they are letting the slim in to sell you their junk inventory, and there isn\\'t a damn thing you can do about it. Don\\'t even get me started on 3rd party sellers, JUST STAY AWAY IS YOUR BEST BET. I bought 2 of them, the first one was ok, (keeping figures crossed that it stays that way) the second one refuse to come on, I\\'m currently traveling with a none functional chrome book, I would advise against buying this chrome book, you might get a busted one like I did. I contacted Amazon Support who sent me to the Manufacture Support who indicated there is nothing that can be done and I have to return the item for a refund. The laptop was purchased renewed. Be careful who you purchase from. Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids. I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm, return item immediately. Such as logging in and out. Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can. I wish I would of. Just a warning. I\\'m sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are? Beware. Screen has lines in an it’s not touch screen an it’s like a 90’s computer but good for very basic laptop\\nI’m returning it need clear picture I received the laptop but cant use it as its asked as soon as i turned it on it asked for my bank/credit card details to purchase memory as its saying its reached memory limit...hmm how can that be as i only just switched it on?............not happy as i only purchased this laptop to talk to relatives on facebook living in england...def been ripped off folks :( The laptop looks nice but the keyboard doesn’t work. Don’t waste your money. This is not the one for me. Decided I don\\'t like Chromebook and went back to my windows laptop. I had to return it and Amazon made it amazingly easy. So I am in my late twenties and plan to go back to school to finish my schooling. I could not afford a Mac so I wanted to see if this would be a great fit . Well I love it . It’s light weight, it looks modern for a Chromebook and it’s in amazing condition. It was delivered on time and the price is unbelievable. This is a great purchase for students . It’s not the fanciest computer but it will get the job done. Merry Christmas everyone🧡 Cheap, bare minimum, almost not worth it. Save frustration. Just buy an unused, brand-new computer. The money is better spent This computer was exactly what I needed for work. Great price and does what I need it to. i carry it wherever i go, it is the best laptop i have ever used This Chromebook is really fast, easy to navigate. Excellent battery life. I can add more users, no more small phone screen for all my apps. Can used anywhere, it\\'s like carrying a small notebook. Really amazing with the unit and the fast delivery. For now, I don\\'t see a thing that makes me dislike this laptop , I love the color,it\\'s slim, light to carry so far it\\'s perfect for me.I only use it for browsing, Netflix and you tube. Works great I have an old printer espon and it wasn\\'t up dated on the espon app. I would reconmend this computer to anyone. it does what i need it to do. This Product is a Great Product, however the internet drops whenever i use Microsoft Teams Doesn’t support enough apps in the play store, but for the price it does what the bare minimum of what a laptop needs to do. Overall, it’s a decent laptop for the price it offers, wasn’t what I was expecting though I’ve had no issues with it and the battery lasts all day for me. I bought it for college. It doesn’t have a backlit keyboard but everything else is excellent on it. Love this laptop its my first and its worth every penny ❤ my laptop looks brand new I am in love with the final product I recieved. The device i slightweight and compact and does exactly what I need it to do. I did receive the product late but I\\'m certain that was a postal issue. Great product from a great company, I highly recommend this product for a student or teacher who is looking for a good work horse computer. :) Great buy. I purchased this for my son and he loves it. It is great value for the money. Looks and feels brand new, no visible imperfections close up or held at arms length. Screen is crisp, sound is clear and the webcam and mic works great Light weight and a great value for the money. I loved the product, it\\'s super good The package arrived beaten and the screen therefore broke. The guarantee allowed me a full refund of the money. I chose the wrong product. I would have preferred a pc with windows since I have never worked with a Chromebook with OS before. It has killed my production. I would love to exchange this unit for something that I am more familiar with. You advertised this as a touch screen and it’s not! I got it for my elderly grandma and now it’s basically a faster version of the last laptop she had trouble using. If I wanted a good laptop I’d say it’s a good purchase but I paid for something else. For what I paid and what I got it far exceeded my expectations. Lightweight with a long battery life . If you are looking for a notebook that delivers the HP 2020 Flagship has everything you are looking for . I bought this for my son is light weight has a decent amount of storage and will get the job done if using it for school. He is in high school so school papers it is good enough for. U will need a cord to hook to a printer. It looks like a brand new product. Everything is perfect except the power button is not really responsive. 4 star for this product Easy to set up. Works great. Looks great. Great price. Happy with purchase. it\\'s okay ,it doesn\\'t have touch screen but could have one more usb port , Worked perfect out of the box. Was packaged well. Like the product and works well for what I needed. It shipped fast and arrived early. Looks brand new. No problems so far so good. Thanks! works great & great price Nice! The item was supreme and prime! Quality of the wrapping was rad. Immensely speedy delivery. Service was grand. Like new, that\\'s why I repeated It\\'s a good product for school children,easy to control from parents end using family link I thought I was buying into a cheap laptop!! But NOPE! Works awesome and never let me down! Would of been great to have touchscreen. Works great I love it! Great Brand New! No scratches or anything like \"Used\" mark. Work without problem and very fast! really good chrome book... battery life is insanely good anywhere from 6-12 hours on a charge and the 1080p screen is great and it can play 4k youtube with no problem which is awesome!!!! really great condition also looked like it was never used... 5 stars!!! definitely recommend Great for my use. I\\'m retired and use my computer for saving and creating personal docs. More than enough computer for personal use or young students. At a great price. First day with it and I can already yell it is just going g to get the bare minimum done. But the bare minimum is all I really need I guess. However I can\\'t help but feel that a $150 could be better spent on another laptop. It\\'s great, it works very well and at an excellent price Very nice It arrived very well packaged due to its characteristics, it is a very well optimized Chromebook, in addition to the fact that it is aesthetically very beautiful, elegant and super thin, in the description it indicates it has a Celeron processor but reviewing it it has a pentium N5030 with 4 cores and with its 4gb of ram It works perfectly for office automation, multimedia, video games, etc., you can edit your documents in Googledocs or Office, the only thing is that in the description it says with a Backlit keyboard and it is not like that, it has Wi-Fi 5 and 2.4, Bluetooth, the keyboard comes without the ñ but It\\'s no problem, you just use Alt+n on the extended US keyboard so as not to lose the configuration. A device that is worth one hundred for what you pay and although it is renovated, it comes with new aesthetics and functionality and with updates until June 2026, I think you can do a little more with this laptop going from the average user, totally recommended for office work, school and video games. Excellent buy!!! It is very pretty, practical and comfortable, besides that for its price it does not ask others.\\nThe only problem is that I am a teacher and I use word and power point, etc. And with this computer it has been difficult for me to work in drive and in applications similar to the windos package because they are not the same and sometimes they are limited. I have used it for about a month and a half, I have liked it a lot and it has exceeded my expectations. It is light, fast, easy to use, very good resolution. It connects to easy WiFi. And fast, and also from my cell phone they are linked.\\nHonestly, I am not very skilled in new technology issues, however, using Google documents as a word processor, power point presentations or video conferences in meet or zoom, has been very easy for me to use.\\nI can move it and take it on a trip, it weighs little, it is a good size, like a professional notebook.\\nThe Mac type cover is made of aluminum.\\nI read some reviews since they always help me decide my purchase, that\\'s why I did the same, I highly recommend it. I arrive perfectly packaged, earlier than expected.\\nThank you Good for elementary school kids jobs Chromebooks are really good products.\\nThis one has a fast startup, like rocket fast compared to windows 10.\\nlong battery life.\\nrecommended product\\n\\nThis is the second submission of this review after the first submission was rejected by amazon for not meeting guidelines. Almost unbelievable. easy to use and complements my daughter\\'s study I am very happy with my purchase, the laptop works without problems. I had my doubts because it was a renewed article, but it convinced me a lot, quality-price is excellent. I highly recommend it I bought this item for home school for one of my children, the chromebook is super practical and easy for children to use, ideal for home school! I loved! I bought it to work from home. I\\'ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it has run everything quite smoothly. 5/5 The laptop is a chromebook so it doesn\\'t have windows, the advantage is that it comes with linux so the operating system already has me convinced to start programming, and that\\'s very good for me. Price-quality ratio, it is excellent, super fast and I use it to create documents and teach online, it works great for me It does not have a windows operating system, but it is very fast, functional, the design is very good since it is very light Impeccable, but the keyboard and mousepad are lenses and do not seem to be of premium quality, especially when you come from using a Macbook all your life, everything from an Android cell phone is literally on a laptop, what you do on a cell phone you will Being able to do on this computer that with your ChromeOS is going to have its limitations. I arrive like new, impeccable and I will proceed to return it because it is not fast, only to pay and to turn it on. I like everything about this computer -- it was a dream to set up and connect to the Internet; it is extremely sleek and portable; the casing is very attractive. A perfect choice for a student or a busy housewife. Perfect function!\\nAmazon you are the best! I asked you for a smaller lap and you gave me a bigger one!! The tears in my daughter\\'s eyes when receiving her gift are priceless! It is very light, the sound is very good, the image is very clear, the keyboard is in English, but it is super fast, I loved it. Good product, excellent sound, does not weigh much, I arrive earlier than expected. I quite liked it. I liked the quality, in addition to the fact that the specifications that come in the product are the real ones. Good product arrived in estimated time Great functionality and price. The battery lasts a long time! Good product, for basic computing uses, easy to adapt operating system, good sound, good resolution. Very good value for money. It is very versatile, it runs very well as it is a chromebook, you don\\'t need so much memory, if you are used to another operating system, you get used to it in an organic way, great product, recommended for work and leisure, it is not a gaming lap Excellent size, image resolution and quality... It was a gift for my daughter\\'s graduation and we loved it!! It is very light, I loved the color and very easy to program and use. I 100% recommend it. Excellent product, good quality, good price It broke my expectations, I was expecting something of lower quality but it is an excellent tool. It is very worth it. Light, easy to use, excellent value for money. Wonderful. It is very light and practical! I loved! Good device, fair payment for what it provides A very good computer for a very affordable price'"

       "'i do audio work for video games creating sfx in a daw digital audio workstation and or composing midi mockup scores using kontakt and a ton of heavy ram use orchestral sample library the g ram on this and the tb ssd is a HUGE boon for audio work i use both ableton and reaper daw they load super snappy my kontakt heavy projects load ultra fast now versus the pc tower i was using which was still quite powerful the laptop runs fairly quiet even at heavier cpu loads i composed a piece of music for a game of thrones video game which ran about cpu on my other fastest computer the pc tower this hp laptop it clocks in at a cool so ive been able to have tons of cpu intense plugins such as ozone or reaktor running in the daw projects no problem i was able to turn the cpu down to in the windows power management panel and set the cooling to passive which causes the laptop to run slower but basically run silent because less heat generation which is perfect when i need to record foley or my own voice for use with creatures in the games i can then turn the cpu back up to full speed when composing or integrating the sound and music into the games the graphics card on this isnt the best but im still able to run unity and hook up sounds into d games that way without any lag via a k screen really this isnt a gaming pc only due to the level integration of its graphics card like you might not be able to easily run the latest greatest fps at full settings and stream on twitch at the same time without some drop in frame rate but who knows maybe u can i didnt test this fully but im confident you could still run just about any game regardless w tweaked setting most likely just as a test i loaded up one of my all time fav games skyrim and one of the heftier mods and it seemed to run amazingly well in k with all the game s graphics settings turned up i havent tried video capturing a game like that but with the right settings in obs i think it could work fine probably no more than fps id imagine i do do a lot of video capturing for my job getting animations and vfx clips to bring into the daw to make sound effects with and so far this laptop does not even blink w those basic vid cap tasks i also do photography and video editing on the side for my own projects photoshop runs like a total breeze on this ive never had a smoother photoshop experience personally after effects is fast to edit splice preview etc but some of the render times especially when using twixtor still take time a minute time stretched vector blend k video with color correction and film grain layers added took about hr to render so obvs not the best laptop out there for major video effects work but i think still totally doable and capable for those working more in the premiere type video editing layout arena my only complaint is that the laptop feels cheapo plastic this is my first non mac in a while so theres that so for work traveling which is why i ultimately got this i think ill need to get a good solid case and just treat this like a newborn baby during its life span with the crazy power of this thing given the requirements of my audio photoshop work i think this will be a super solid computer for me for the next years at least and for what a crazy steal I ve had this laptop for a week now which has been enough time for me to gauge my issues with it Speaker volume auto adjusts video footage provided Okay so I figured this first one out so skip this paragraph unless you have the same issue cuz I ll mention my solution at the end of it I ve troubleshooted this through every process suggested online and can t seem to find a solution or explanation Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it ll cut to a lower volume and then stay there And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again it ll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume This happens exclusively with the speaker as in the headphones work just fine I ve turned off enhancements changed every setting in the control panel sound settings options sound settings uninstalled and reinstalled drivers uninstalled and reinstalled B O Nothing fixes the issue and it s very noticeable I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers the volume fluctuating is that noticeable Okay so I figured that out I needed to go to device manager and instead of trying to update the audio driver by searching automatically for one I had to instead search for one that came already downloaded on the computer In this case what fixed my problem was setting the audio driver to the HD one and then going back to the control panel speaker settings and going to the enhancements tab that wasn t present before to turn off all enhancements This fixed the stupid auto volume adjusting crap The default audio driver just sucks not having much needed options Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it s hard to see regardless with heavy resistance Now I wouldn t mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing But in this case the keyboard does not have lit keys has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it s hard to make out what they keys are and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press Think of like a membrane keyboard but just a little more resistant than that Very clicky noisy too It doesn t feel great but I could probably get used to it all bit color bit depth I do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use phone and computer monitor Then when I found that the display was set as a bit color bit depth I realized that this might be the reason why After searching all around online to see if this was changeable I ve concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself Not the best and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed And then here are some non issues that I ve faced as in things I ve been frustrated with but it s not that big of a deal It comes preloaded with Windows I just downloaded and did a fresh reboot with that Battery life isn t the greatest but I wasn t expecting much in that department So much bloatware but I guess that s more the fault of Microsoft than HP since Windows includes all kinds of useless crap that I spent roughly hours removing Everything else has been great If I can just get used to the keyboard the placement of every key and the weight of them then this seems like a purchase generally worth I ll just have to accept less than ideal color depth it s not that bad tbf I wouldn t mind spending a couple hundred more to fix these issues and maybe have separate action keys that aren t the same as the function keys since I use those quite often I might consider that but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school and just other things outside my room which I know this will suffice for a good while Its a pretty good laptop very fast and good with games But have problems with short battery and also wifi connecting issue No Backlight on the keyboard and the keys are black with dark grey writing Very hard to see at night etc Has windows which isn t my favorite Some bloatware Otherwise so far so good good value This is by far the fastest laptop I have ever owned It starts up very quickly and shuts down quickly When you open an excel file the file opens before the click of the mouse fades away core processer GB of memory TB solid state drive Extended display with little display border Nice display Very thin and light The people who put in the upgrades must have used soft gloves because the computer did not have a scratch on it and started up as a brand new computer All for including tax is an incredible value I do agree with one reviewer that the letters on the key could be more white if color to see them easier but that is such a minor issue to all of the plusses If your current laptop has become sloe for you this is a great replacement at a more than reasonable price It worth The Ryzen chip is very fast and there is no lag with the video response with the onboard Radeon graphics I m thrilled with the GB of RAM and the TB SSD It s an incredible little powerhouse and clearly with the price tag My only problem with the computer is the poor design of the keyboard Okay I knew going in that the keyboard wasn t BACKLIT but I never thought they would be STUPID enough to have BLACK keys with CHARCOAL LETTERING It makes it nearly impossible to use in low light environments I had to resort to propping a small flashlight against my head and shoulder to illuminate the keyboard adequately to see what I was typing I later ordered a USB LED light to provide the light source but really WHY NOT A BRIGHT WHITE LETTERING ON THE BLACK KEYES SMFH I bought this laptop for scientific computing and I was waiting for one with an core processor for parallelized computations When I saw a Ryzen core processor GB RAM and the price before tax it ticked This HP Ryzen laptop exceeded my expectations in speed and energy efficiency I ran a benchmark test of Wolfram Mathematica the software I use for computations and the results were far above all other computers listed there for comparison At the same time the laptop does not consume much energy its power adapted is small I run a parallelized computation using all cores for hours and the laptop s body is only a little bit warm I do not hear any sound of the fan This is a huge step forward in comparison to my previous laptops with Intel i processors that consumed a lot of energy and were getting hot even in the idling regime On the other hand it is apparently not a gaming laptop as it has an AMD Radeon graphics card no expensive Nvidia that I don t need Comparable gaming laptops cores on Amazon cost twice as much I haven t found any serious drawbacks yet A small drawback is that the keyboard is not illuminated from within the body of this laptop and its keys are gray while inscriptions on the keys are not white but grayish With low light you don t see them well and you cannot work at night without a light The keyboard is much better visible on my preceding Dell Inspiron laptop Intel i also energy efficient and overall good that has a black surface and keys white key inscriptions and keyboard illumination I like this HP Pavilion I ve owned several HP computers and printers before I m currently using an HP printer and this computer is the one I m now reviewing It works great I m able to type this review with no worries there have only been a few minor glitches all fixable by me So far at least HP has a lot of great support services in general and this hard drive is just under one terabyte they never seem to make it up to the full hard drive status they advertise And I m worried about defragmenting the drive it s a solid state drive and you can t really defragment a drive of that type without harming the machine Or the hard drive So I m hoping it will be okay and I can manage without using defragmentation services I ve had this computer for a couple of weeks now I paid about including tax CA Not a lot of computer makers offer a Ryzen U yet With MB of RAM and TB SSD it s almost a steal It doesn t offer frills like folding back the display touch screen or lighted keys But what I would have liked is Windows Professional instead of Home and School I made it dual boot and installed openSUSE Leap next to Windows The dual boot works fine However I haven t been successful yet getting the Ryzen to work at full resolution That s not HP s fault but rather AMD which doesn t provide its Radeon drivers as public domain Overall so far I m happy with this computer I hope it will last a long time Everything is great only the color of the keyboard is a little uncomfortable Bought this for our son for college but hasn t been used much yet He seems pleased with it so far Mic doesn t pick up well when speaker is off or at edge of camera but it is faster than the Ryzen I murdered lighter weight too I thought I would miss my in screen but in is okay since the resolution is good laptop looks great screen is worderfull specs are great and gives power no backlite to see keyboard but overall laptop is great I have had the laptop for a few days and I am pleased with what I have experienced thus far The body is rigid The performance speed is impressive I recommend it without hesitation good quality and good value for money Very cheap amazing laptop for work I use this laptop for coding and it is very efficient at the job It s amazing how a gb tb ssd core laptop can be this cheap The only thing I find a bit annoying is that I need to charge at least once a day for my job but I guess it is expected due to the high end requirements A laptop with excellent capacity the games and programs run very well I can work comfortably without it crashing It was nice to find this laptop with upgraded RAM I needed a new laptop for the graduate level I do mapping and basic photogrammetry so I ve just installed AutoCAD ReCap QGIS and Metashape So far everything has been running smoothly Although the fan begins to sound I think is normal I purchased this in March Right away the unit was going to sleep an I could only wake it by using the power button to turn it off and on a star HP tech fixed that A couple of weks ago it started freezing and turning off After several hours on a bad phone connection they decided to send me a USB recovery drive which wiped Windows and all the applications After doing that and reloading the apps it started again This time it was shutting down because of Windows errors Finally Microsoft told me that it was no doubt a hardware issue but showed me how to reload Windows in a way that would keep my files and apps in place Told me that should fix it unless it is a hardware issue Didn t work I leave for an hour come back and it s re booted I m a small business man that relies on my computer HP s solution is to send me a postage paid box for me to pack the computer and send back to them so they can repair it Meantime I m left without a way to communicate with and service my customers I used to use HP inkjet printers They were good for about a year before dying I m through with HP Bought myself a nice Lenovo for a great price at Costco today Anybody wants a doorstop you can have one just pay the postage I am very satisfied with this product Quick Start Up thank for SSD drive Fast performance thank for Ryzen Great for multi task GB RAM Battery last for a long time Excellent equipment it is quite fast the screen resolution is very good aesthetically it is very beautiful super light in weight I use the laptop for PowerPoints projection Xcel etc Utilize it on a network and it hooked right up and worked great Not a single complaint Love it Very fast and loaded with all the Hp MS Windows Office tools to get up and running To fast and good quality I don t recommend this computer I am having lots of issues with connecting to WiFi at my house The old computers located in the same area as this new laptop are connecting as expected I work in a hybrid role and I need this laptop to be able to connect to WiFi wherever I am I guess I m going to have to take this to the shop since I m outside the return period Do not buy this computer from this seller You have been warned We ordered a unit with Win Pro bit We received Win Home will not work with our software so we sent it back THE FBA SELLER HAS NOT CALLED ME AS PROMISED BY AMAZON AND I AM UNABLE TO REACH THEM THE VIDEO CAMERA FOR ZOOMS DOESN T WORK AND THEY REVISED THE SOFTWARE BUT AMAZON IS SAYING TO CONTACT HP DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZING WAREHOUSE DEALS Arrived on time and safely packaged The outer box was heavily damaged but thanks to the good packing job there wasn t a dent or scratch on the actual packaging The laptop itself is pristine to the point I was doubtful of the claimed upgrades but everything checked out as advertised I wasn t sure how much difference I would see in speed but this is lightning fast and very responsive The touch pad and keyboard are crisp and smooth the display is excellent for The OS is Windows home and I m pleasantly surprised how decent it is Overall very pleased with the purchase so far Thanks for the support during installation I love for the fact that its very fast monitor is super clear keyboard is good other than its lightweight and the price it very considerate It s a awesome Truly appreciated I am pleased with this one Bought it to do some development on and it s handling things nicely I trade stocks and crypto so it works great for that I can send all my crypto into my cold wallet and not worry about it being lost on an exchange The computer is amazing however there are manufacturer issues and in order to resolve you have to downgrade your windows I m a writer and student and use non MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling I have a large desktop work computer where most of my work is done I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last but these laptops on average last abut years Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had G of RAM and the other had G of RAM This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the Windows S It is easy to get out of and there is a toggle to change the program to Windows Home which is more capable of evading corporate MS s iron handed ownership of my computer The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions It is just a matter of going into settings and changing it I do not mind the PC and MS marriage but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook This one is constantly asking begging me to turn on my Cloud service and turn on other MS Programs I do not do any of that and I do not want to send my work to the cloud When I import it into the big machine I will I like that it has an extra USB port Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook which I like but cannot use because of the non MS proprietary writing programs I use As far as using it for entertainment or videos the sound is nice and loud but not blasting the picture is great and it does not buffer endlessly but that may be my internet service My overall opinion is nice It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend on top of the line equipment Nope this is just a tuck it in the bag and go type computer This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost It s a beautiful color and it has a clean look My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it s great for the price This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose and homework The vaule is good for the money spent The one we got is not touch screen We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it but I restart it and then have no problems after that It is also good speed computer We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems I needed a PC just for internet browsing email and the like For just over delivered this PC fills the bill It may be a refurb but mine looks like new not a scratch or ding anywhere There s a camera but no touchscreen There s Windows it took about an hour to update the year old build It s fast enough for my purposes And it looks good too not nearly as pink as in the pictures I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do touch screen works perfectly This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I m very happy with it for the price Wasn t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability thank god when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that s what I ve been using it for This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials The computer operates great and has no issues Great product Excellent product touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop The size is great it s in perfect condition I would highly recommend this And Pink light weight easy to use I like the slim design of the HP Laptop Its very light no extra battery to replace Easy to do work on battery life is excellent so far Screen quality is great sound quality is also very nice I love mine The laptop is light and very sleek It doesn t run slow It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices I play games sometimes and it doesn t lag FYI No this is not touch screen The laptop came with the charger I ve had it for about two months So far so good I don t use it for gaming or anything like that Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media This computer is sleek modern looking I only use it for chrome and Google drive documents may need open at a time It loads sooooo painfully slow that I almost can t do what I need to do So you get what you paid for But the color is cute Very easy to use Quite fast Excellent for the money Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work Great laptop and a terrific price I am very pleased with my laptop Delivery was prompt and the laptop was in excellent condition It was very easy to set up For the price it s a great deal As functional as it is beautiful It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds A great buy When the computer arrived I carefully took it out and tried to power it on it didn t turn on so I placed it on the charger for mins to an hour and it still wouldn t power on After further investigating the issue I noticed that the light didn t even come on whenever I had it plugged in charging I thought maybe something happened to my outlet I had it plugged into so I tried four more different outlets throughout my house Still no light came on indicating that it was getting power to it to charge It had a sticker on the box as seen in one of the picture that I took that the computer had been tested for full functions and was ready for reuse That s a lie I m highly disappointed and I would not recommend this to anyone Save yourself the time and trouble and avoid this product exellent product good quality I love the touch screen the most Lol but overall great investment The computer works just fine but I cant activate Windows due to no windows product key Love this computer Work great Love the color I didn t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised Easy to start up walks you right through start up Great price I received this laptop in great condition however it didn t come with a charging cable My only option was to return the entire thing get a replacement or buy a cord separately I didn t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included and I saw other customer photos that included it I m annoyed that I ll have to pay for one separately or go through the hassle or returning and recording it I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen Turns out it was too good to be true That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download videos I watch or updates I complete They lied to most of us or they re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color Low cost Works good Would buy again It s great Better than my old one Great for the money spent Haven t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn t touchscreen However Customer Service and tech support is very good tech read many test and confirmed it wasn t touchscreen either but still this is not a touch screen They sent a replacement swiftly and still wasn t a touchscreen but they were fast paid shipping paid return paid freed pickup from home and quick refund Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed They shouldn t advertise it as touchscreen though I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for If you don t need touchscreen than this can be a great computer for you Looks like picture too My laptop stopped working exactly months after purchase Never will purchase another refurbished pc First and last Avoid refurbished Nothing is able to be saved on this computer I m returning it Recommend DI NOT BUY I love the color the screen looks excellent but it is too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished Very upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already While I was working it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere see pics It happened multiple times This last time the screen wouldn t come back and I had to turn off and turn on again Not reliable I had it for a week only I will be returning this I spent extra and got a brand new one Too risky At first it was taking forever mins and a blank screen to log in I was ready to take it back Then I tried to update and restart then it started up right away Hopefully this can handle my daughter s first year of college So far not bad for price The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor Arrived like new Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid It is a great little laptop I love finding these great buys in the refurbished renewed shop Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great product Thanks This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it s literally a steel I love it It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer Easy set up and love the color Great purchase Was a little scared at first to get but I m happy I did To replace a later hp laptop Needed something smaller More for ME I m very satisfied Not a single scratch or issue Beautiful color also This product came in impeccable condition I was a tad bit surprised that the color popped so nicely The system runs very well I am very impressed with this lightweight laptop as I travel a great deal for business Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy It s a keeper for sure Price can t be bet Works great I got this a few months ago and it works fine the screen is tearing flickering but It was something I installed and not a hardware problem But it works as expected My biggest dislike is Windows This laptop is forcing me to develop new skills It is a huge departure from the Vista OS that took me forever to become comfortable with I bought this laptop to replace my old laptop because the Vista OS wasn t getting updates I primarily use the laptop as a storage device for images and music I am not a gamer other than The Solitaire Suite which I like very much on this computer I do surf the web and shop with the device also I can t comment on the battery life or the gaming capabilities of this laptop I really am not sure whether it is a good value I know it cost more than I expected considering it doesn t have a DVD burner or player I like and appreciate the upgraded Ram and Hard drive space compared to my old Laptop I really didn t want to buy a laptop that relied on the cloud as I use the device in areas where I don t have internet access Do I like it Yes I do The machine itself seems pretty nice It is way faster than my old machine I was able to run two external monitors once I got the right cable I m not a gamer I just run a few business applications Get the bigger disk I got and should have gotten the larger disk because after updating windows with all its patches I only have about GB free BEWARE OF THIS SELLER I was very surprised to buy a new machine and find out when I got it that it was manufactured in and the HP warranty is already over I contacted the seller to see if they would pay to extend the warranty and got no response from them or Amazon Maybe buy this somewhere else or make sure you get a warranty included ive seen people say that the battery life isn t good but I don t think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop the picture quality is ecxcellent the specs overall are great for under k its upgradable it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO with no use the light goes off all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they ll come back on im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked I actually prefer that to minimize battery use while using without gaming the battery life is actually pretty good so far ive played terraria and fallout and they both play great on ultra settings I think im going to install battlefield and see how it runs not a big fan of the game itself but that s the most resource intense game I own kinda curious how itll run the laptop is more than vr ready I love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing oh ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving mine didn t either YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY LOL oh and I also received the laptop within a day and a half ordered friday night and got it sunday overall I highly recommend I needed a new laptop for gaming streaming etc I went with HP because my old HP laptop is years old and still works fairly well and that impressed me that I was getting something new that would last awhile But as always happens it had become frustratingly technically out of date for running some games and was also very slow due to low free memory This new model is tons more powerful and triple the memory I have yet to find a game I was unable to play on it and watching videos streams is mostly without flaw Battery life is not great I would imagine because of the amount of energy it needs to be as cool as it is This was not a deal breaker for me because I really wasn t getting it for portable use anyway so mine is always plugged in relatively minor issues I ve had should be noted The keyboard is backlit but this model turns off the backlighting after about seconds of you not typing As far as I m concerned that defeats the purpose of the feature in that it doesn t remain constantly lit in the dark There are no BIOS or other setting options to change this so it s a little annoying Secondly there seems to be a slight problem with the volume when watching movies off of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix At MAXIMUM speaker volume and MAXIMUM stream volume the sound is acceptable but you can t get it any higher than an average output It does NOT however have this problem when playing games so I dunno what s up with that I contacted HP about it but they ve never gotten back to me on it I ve found it to be a pretty minor annoyance though as if needs be I can still use my old laptop if I need to watch something at a louder volume All in all I m pretty happy with this model though I ll update this review if anything new good or bad comes up with it I decided to wait months of using it before offering my opinion and there you have it I can play gears at fps on this laptop and some modern games like god of war and gears and I like the graphics card and it also plays my games in vr too and I love it a lot it s one of the best laptops in in my opinion if you re looking for a cheap one and I like to play old games mostly on my computer like Gta and aliens colonial marines and newer games like gods of war and gears and Monster hunter rise Best laptop I ve owned Love the look of it with the green and black beautiful at night in the dark with the keyboard lit green Its been perfect for me playing Lost Ark no problems at all Also I did the Used Like New option and the laptop is in perfect condition not a single scratch Battery life is decent when gaming it last a couple hours star rating is perfect Let me start by saying it IS a laptop I needed one to replace my aging laptop so that I could be up to speed since I am a college student so it needed to have storage capabilities speed and be able to handle various processes with a decent battery At moderate usage the battery usually lasts about hrs having multiple tabs open software compilers etc I strongly dislike MacAfee so I uninstalled that right off the bat and use a different antivirus This laptop is great for needing to be on the go since it is not large and it also sports Wifi and ethernet ports which can work in tandem with each other connect to both at the same time The RAM can also be upgraded which I plan to upgrade the GB stick to an GB stick at some point There s no good time to buy a laptop so don t waste too much time with comparisons get the best you can afford and don t look back to see that the price dropped the next day it probably did This one plays everything I ve given it so far at Ultra settings on x and that s all I need It was fairly easy to put extra RAM in there The screen quality is fine for me It runs a bit hot when it s going flat out in a game but it hasn t blown up yet The combination of price and performance was a sweet spot for me on the day I bought it and if the price has gone down since or there s a better performer for the price I paid I m not going to stress out over it The specs will tell you it s not perfect but it s pretty darn good for the price and I have no reservations about having bought it at all It looks smart and thin and just businesslike enough that it might not be stolen immediately you look the other way unlike some gaming laptops It s a major league fingerprint magnet if that worries you I m very happy with it I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do touch screen works perfectly This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I m very happy with it for the price Wasn t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability thank god when it

Thanks This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had

travel a great deal for business Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy It s a keeper for sure Price can t be bet Bought this unit to replace a Lenovo that froze and would have cost to fix The battery lasts a lot longer than the Lenovo I don t use it for office composing the great American novel I did add a cord free mouse as I do NOT like a built in mouse ever a thin strip of card stock over the built in mouse held in place with two rubber bands solves the touchy mouse problem This unit does exactly what is stated that it will do some people don t read the description and are thus flumexed Hello Good purchase Been using for awhile no problems with it Works great was a good price This is my first Chromebook and overall I m quite pleased with the purchase I m mainly going to be using it for basic internet browsing and writing so when I was shopping for the right model I was favoring cost weight and battery life over other features like screen size and processing power I ultimately felt this was the best balance of weight and battery life for the price I definitely wasn t wrong about the battery life I m amazed This thing lasts and lasts It s not the fastest computer but it suffices for my use case Two things that bother me This first is the lack of an illuminated keyboard I knew it lacked one going into it so I can t complain that much I just didn t realize how much I ve come to rely on it on my other laptops I m often using the computer in dark environments where it s difficult to see the keys Again I knew this wasn t an included feature so this isn t really a complaint as much as something to give extra consideration to before purchasing With that being said even with the lack of the illuminated keyboard I don t regret the purchase and would buy again Which takes me to the second point There is an issue with some of the video playback In extra bright scenes in videos on YouTube and elsewhere there is some discoloration in the highlights Meaning that in certain areas of the video particularly that are white there is some blue artifacts pixelation happening I have confirmed that this is an issue with this model and have seen it replicated in floor models at Best Buy and heard other people complain about this I m frustrated that HP has allowed this to continue to be a problem without offering a fix As I said most of my use cases involve writing so video watching isn t high up on my list of priorities If it was this would be a much bigger problem for me Overall I m pleased with the purchase given the price and recommend it for anybody who is looking for an inexpensive long battery life Chromebook option I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars So far this fits the bill pretty well with a few minor differences from the Macbook It was really easy to set up and import my passwords bookmarks etc which was really convenient Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included I also miss having iTunes now Apple Music but I switched to Spotify There are a few little things that are different that I ve had to get used to but nothing too major I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen not a touchscreen tablet or a little tiny screen phone All in all it s a great little laptop for the price The PC works fine but I do NOT like Windows It keeps popping up when I m trying to things and wants me to do this or that Stuff I do not need or want I don t use the touch screen so can t say anything about that If I could put Win on it the laptop would be perfect Good product based on its price so far excellent the only thing is that I have not been able to porner the touch screen If you don t mind looking at a small iffy quality screen then this Chromebook is fine for you If you increase the letters on the screen too large then it negatively effects your webpages and how many tabs you can have open It is fairly quick for it s price point and allowed me to get schoolwork done when needed I wouldn t feel bad if I cracked the screen or broke it a few years from now since the price isn t bad If these types of screens bother your eyes I highly recommend IPS displays You can get this same exact laptop but with an IPS display for only a few bucks more All in all I decided to return it after my eyes were hurting from squinting at the screen I went with a Lenovo Chromebook C inch Google operating system and apps are relatively new to me But they seem useful Not high power but good for what I needed it for Bill payments etc Nice and compact Rugged build Screen not as bright as I would like Good value It s easy to set up especially if you re already connected to Google I m already excited about it for such a good price It has a nice screen quality I just pray it continues to work well Update Below First I should say that it s not the Chromebook s fault It works fine as it was built It s not the machine s fault that its model was built without a touch screen I am a bit cranky with HP for making something of a big noise about their new a economy Chromebook with a touch screen and then building a model of the a without one If you go to the HP site and enter all twelve characters of the model number and ask for specs the specifications displayed won t mention a touch screen because the a na nr doesn t have one The a na nr does have a touch screen but the does not None of this changes the fact that the product is misrepresented The listing describes the machine as The powerful MediaTek mobile processor full size keyboard and inch touchscreen can handle it all With an anti glare high definition inch touch display you can stream So at two places in the About This Item text it promises a touch screen which the item does not have Initially I thought about returning the machine but on reflection the lack of a touch screen is not a deal breaker I decided that instead of returning the machine I would leave a one star review instead UPDATE Too many problems Sending the Chromebook back Problems that emerged since my previous review I can t make the SD card reader work I can activate the device in the device settings but most of the apps don t see it The settings for the individual apps don t show the card in the External Storage Preferences Notably Netflix can t see the card You can t download much video to watch offline if you can t get to the SD card Also although the item was sold as new with a one year warranty when I presented the serial number to the HP support page it informed me that the warranty was started in April of and expired this April just passes So there is no warranty Googling the support communities found only one thread discussing a similar problem last month but the only participant who resolved the problem did so by returning the machine Starting to sound like the machine needs to go back HP Chromebook didn t work out of the box There s an error connecting to my WiFi network even though it is in fact connected and works in guest mode I never could get to the setup screens Sent it away to HP to be fixed because it has a day warranty I ll update my review whenever I m able to use it Update I received the CB back from HP and the same problem is still occurring I spent about minutes with their online support to be told it needs to go back to HP to be fixed If it isn t fixed this time I m returning it Each time I speak with someone they ask me about upgrading my warranty which is even more frustrating Why should I pay more money to purchase a warranty on a product that has never worked when I can return it for one that does Update After a month my CB is working well I really like it Just wish it hadn t taken a month to get it working HP service was prompt and effective the second time around Shipping took the most time Make sure you have a day warranty Portable and lightweight this Chromebook offers robust responsiveness and reliability I ve owned about Chromebooks since they were introduced and this one ranks right up there near the tops in value and function Perfect for carrying around and using near anywhere Good product for the price I strictly use it for school and it works great Decent laptop for light use Really hard to plug anything into USB port because its so tight Decent battery life This Chromebook is very similar to my past Chromebook so the transition was very easy I needed to replace my old chromebook because it was outdated and about to lose its updates Also it was big and cumbersome so I needed something smaller and lighter I like the chromebook so when I found this one it looked perfect for what I needed It s fast has great screen quality and has google backup for six years It is not a touchscreen But it has a full sized keyboard and works well with a wireless mouse I m satisfied and I m sure you will be too Great for the price My only complaint is the trackpad isn t that good My Apple ID was hacked online banking had to be shut down etc I ordered this and was expecting it to be a learning curve but it was quick and simple to set up and just what I needed A PS I entered my Google conditionals and poof Everything was there So far so good Perfect size for me perfect for on the go and school work Not as easy as I expected Ideal for studies I purchased two of these items both of them had the same display problem which when I opened up a web page everything looked fine then when I went into it like let s say Netflix it looked like x ray people like high contrast was on and it wasn t I opened up other web pages the same thing on two laptops I got the same thing I don t know if anybody else is experiencing this but I had to send them both back After thinking why would seperate laptops have the exact same problem I figured it out I had a contrast extension installed on my chrome web browser and once i removed it both laptops were fine So far thank you for a good purchase Perfect for traveling Wife loves the light weight and ease of use Fast on and off too You can t use anything Microsoft This one is not touch screen but for the price it s perfect and I am able do use it for what I need I like the way HP does keyboards and touch pads and this product lives up to my expectations ChromeOS has come a long way since I last looked at it years or so ago This notebook has the ability to run Debian Linux in a chroot environment that has display access for GUI applications which is an enormous plus for me The MediaTek MT SoC runs very quickly and no lags or apparent memory shortage even with lots of tabs open The wifi radios are killer great speed and range If you are old like me it s not great But kids use it for school work I used it as a backup in clinic when my computer froze and it worked perfectly Just make sure u use your bifocals I love my laptop My wife uses it more than I do Lol It s not a big laptop but it has been a really good one my kids have took right to it for school work Ive used it we haven t had one bad thing to say about it and the price was awesome This is a glorified oversized cell phone Apps are okay but I cannot print off this as there are no drivers for my printer Also limited on what you can do with any software and mouse pad Save your money and just buy a laptop The chromebook was great when I FINALLY got it it took days to come Great little machine It works for my needs and is very user friendly The seller was excellent Very timely and arrived well before projected date It s small and compact The screen display I thought would be clearer The battery life is great I can use it for almost days before putting it to charge I use these in my businesss They are very affordable and does the job well I use them for stock taking each year and have never had any problems with them This year I purchased two new ones from Media Tek and refurbished ones fromAmazon prime The refurbished had no issues but The brand new one was not charging I was told that it would be replaced however the supplier recommended that I talk to HP support instead Do not buy from Media Tek These are great little chrome books that are affordable I love them I don t love this Supplier Very good for myuse It s a good laptop it s got an excellent price but figuring out how to work Chromebook is a bit sometimes beyond me Its great for my yr old Great price for what u get Would be nice to have a larger keyboard and scree option However this gets the job done for what I need at the time Great buy I bought this computer for schoolwork about a month ago and it works fabulous Especially for the price I would definitely recommend Bought this for my son to use for the virtual school days and its almost perfect We ran into a slight hiccup because there s no windows button or caps lock key and he needs to know them for computer class Otherwise its perfect for Google classroom This is about the th or th Chromebook in the family and happy so far Was looking for something something kids could abuse and also suitable for semi rough treatment at the beach camping etc Also wanted excellent battery life which this has non touch screen version typically hrs plus at about brightness Is very snappy with new processor Screen isn t the highest quality but better than expected at this price All plastic build but very sturdy and more compact than earlier models due to smaller bezels And it gets updates until June If you need a basic laptop to perform basic functions this is perfect Super compact and simple to use The cost is fantastic Perfect for my simple needs Purchased this for my mother to replace her year old HP laptop that was beginning to decline She loves it and finds it very easy to use especially being in her s and not very tech savvy Everything is very good except for the sound quality It is very low especially when I have a fan on I use a speaker or loud headphones with it Good for its price though it s just plain good dependable This device is way to restrictive for what it allows you to see or install If you do not give google full access to all your information and locations it will not allow you to install some apps Heck it will not even show me a lot of apps to install The laptop ok but google has just put in to many road blocks to really make it useful It s very important to note this is a Chromebook NOT a full sized laptop so this may be much smaller than expected Personally I love this Chromebook size and all It works great and has a pretty decent quality No issues with so far with charging battery life crashing etc I would only hope for a better sound quality as it doesn t get very loud at all Plenty of storage space for me as well as I use it for crafting Design Space app emails saving photos etc I would also recommend this for those looking for something small with a keyboard for school use This is my home laptop As I have a chrome book at work I am used to using them and appreciate that they seem better protected from hackers than most laptops If you want a fast fairly lightweight laptop at a really low price this is perfect I use it for email online shopping bill pay etc It doesn t have fancy bells and whistles but it s exactly what I needed Does much more than I thought it would Will not accept some apps The screen quality for me is bad it would not and will not register certain colors and decides to make them either teal or blue I can say the touch screen doesn t work because while I didn t know it was supposed to be toutch screen my family tried it and it never worked Still the battery life is decently good It can run most of the things I need hut because of the problems listed above not as well as I would want need All in all with its problems it has and the few positives in comparison I give it two out of five stars My older Chromebook was going to strip receiving updates last month so I needed to update my notebook I couldn t tell you how but while I was struggling with my printer and WiFi the Chromebook just magically downloaded everything from the old one too the new one Like I said I don t do tech the only thing is they were sitting on top of each other I bought for It is a light fast and great for laying in the bed Very fast I use this computer for my business everyday it is fast and the battery life is amazing Pleasantly surprised by how great the battery on this chromebook is I got it on a Saturday charged it to full battery then the next charge was a week after Granted I don t use it often just to go online for a bit and watch Disney but still that s a great battery life Highly recommend just for that alone lol Plus easy interface and controls An overall great buy on a Prime day Bought this to Homeschool my daughter and it works great Easy to use and set up chromebook I didn t realize how small it was however it s a nice laptop the screen did go black for a full day it was charged an everything for some weird reason it came back on that s the only issue I ve had with it Awesome Better than a laptop this chromebook is so fast and easy to use Work s great good picture I bought this laptop after seeing that it has a Touchscreen but it does not If anyone else wants a Touchscreen stay away from this Laptop Loved this compact computer until out of no where it just stopped working Won t turn on Sits at a desk in my office no trauma was on and working stepped away then it was off and would not turn back on Pulled in not a battery issue The display is small and makes focusing on media for any prolonged period a difficult task The processor is quick and efficient and pages load quickly The sleek design offers and easy store and carry It s a get the job done chromebook without many luxuries The battery health is on point there wasn t anything that I disliked about it The features are amazing I owned this laptop for a month when it stopped working After a few days of use it started glitching and the screen would freeze multiple times a day It would require needing to be restarted on a daily basis just so the laptop could become unfrozen Assuming I may just had a bad computer I reached out to the manufacture and they kindly offered to send a second laptop free of charge The second laptop turned out to be worse than the first however After having that second laptop for less than a month it also stopped working When looking at something with white in the web page there would be what can best be described as blue scratch marks all over the screen The company was nice but I would not buy another chromebook from hp again I previously owned a chromebook from Asus that cost half as much ish but yet it lasted me years I wasn t able to even get month out of BOTH of my hp chromebooks Now I bought the basic hp chromebook model without touchscreen It is possible that the touchscreen version of this laptop avoids these issues However I would recommend looking elsewhere Make sure you read the fine print I received my chromebook The package it was in was already opened A little annoyed I paid for a new one and got a used one but it looked ok Plug it in to start using it and check it out Kept saying it was charging Unplugged it the next day only for it to cut righty back off and say it was dead I tried another chromebook charger and the same thing happened So I decided to get some support Amazon was nice but made me try all the things I already did After nothing worked again They told me to contact the seller there was nothing else they could do to help me I reached out to the seller and got no reply And apparently I can t return it For any reason whatsoever So now I have a cr p laptop that I just wasted on that I guess I ll now have to pay to take somewhere to fix it So annoyed and disappointed I haven t even had it a few days and can t even return for a replacement or to get my money back Cool cool cool Thanks took me awhile to figure it out but thanks to youtube got it done Very nice laptop This is perfect for what I need I am a writer and have been writing on a kindle tablet and it was just too small This chromebook was perfect for my teens to do homework The USB spot on the side of the Laptop kept scratching my mouse and Flash drives and they would get stuck in there to the point it felt like if you were to pull it out with minimal strength it would snap I provided an image im not sure if you guys can see it very well but there are lines that were made from scratching on my flash drive Not only that but this laptop was completely useless to me it was recommended to me by an Amazon agent after telling him what i was looking for so i thought they couldn t possibly get it wrong but i was incorrect you can t even download anything on this laptop unless its from the play store it was the equivalent to my Samsung phone everything you could do on this you can do on a phone except a phone is better allows you to download certain files like exe which Chrome Operating systems don t If your looking for a chromebook to use the internet only then its perfect i experienced no lag with it but if you want more than that keep looking Beautiful Easy setup and operation price was competitive and overall a good buy Is perfect Got replica Chromebooks that my kids use at school Work great I liked everything about the product the packaging the product Everything came included there was no missing parts no nothing You so t waste ya time buying this Laptops worked great Came quick good quality This laptop is pretty nice works good it isn t touch screen but works perfectly for what i need it for screen quality is okay but no issues Wow arrived earlier than expected Such a nice small laptop Already enjoying it Lightweight and sleek great buy Works great I currently use it for college and this is definitely an affordable option for those looking for a high quality laptop At first I liked I expected it to be a little bigger but it was small easy to carry and go on to go the touch screen never worked but I was okay with that the real problems came on like the th day after having it for one it does not charge unless it s all even when powered off it barely charged I d have it on the charger for over hours to get on there and only have the keyboard layout constantly changes on you to as though you ll have constant problems with your password and will end up having to use guest mode I do not suggest this product at all The only good thing about this computer was its size and weight Other then that it s better to just get an AO s which is about the same price but runs more programs It doesn t play any games and what it does has a smaller selection then the store on my Samsung phone You can t even jail break it to run Linux without really complex coding And even then it s highly iffy Overall just get a smart phone and skip this PC Thank you The Chromebook is exactly what I needed and the shipping was super fast Would recommend this purchase This version doesn t have a touch screen Worked well right out of the box Great battery life Perfect for watching movies but wish the sound quality was better Also great for work Light compact and battery lasts a long time The keyboard is smaller than I prefer but the functionality is perfect for my needs and budget Does everything we need Fast and efficient at a good price Very happy with this purchase Nice computer Fast Delivery Great Laptop Super Satisfied Nice volume isn t very loud but functions and speeds are sufficient No comment but very useful Love my laptop very fast connection and beautiful video quality Very light and too cheap for me I returned it I have another chromebook but the quality of this is subpar Love it thank you good quality for price love it This chromebook is not near the quality of my Acer chromebook Popups are always coming up and the screen I m viewing changes without any warning or reason Also the screen is not nearly as sharply contrasting as the Acer My advise is to not buy this piece of cheaply made junk Not happy with this computer Great price and arrived on time However when I needed it to take my test to get my health and license license it was not compatible with their testing program I missed my exam that day Out of bucks Have to retake it again and pay more dollars Highly frustrated This was going to be my work computer but not anymore Love spending forever trying to download a chromebook recovery onto an old usb drive because it wouldn t boot at all New out of the box and everything And of course customer service just tells you to contact the manufacturer In all fairness after I had returned it I realized that it had been a refurbished item I didn t know that The return was easy Want a honest review Don t bother ordering the specs are not true and unless you just plan on going online to look at videos on YouTube I wouldn t waste your time This is not even a good starter laptop You can t run any type of software off here better off using your phone to go on YouTube The speed is slow and mine wouldn t even hold a battery charge Returned it Whenever you turn it on there is a loud noise coming out of it not sure why that is I guess it s ready to fall apart ordered two of these and both of them had green blotches on the screen saver and certain youtube videos This product was a Christmas present for my son He was so excited to get it Then come to find out it turns on but you can t see the screen Total bummer It will Be returning Don t buy WASTE OF MONEY Received this product used Previous owner had to remove the personalized name stickers but did not do a good job The HP logo has tons of scratches The track pad has scuff marks and the screen has a deep scratch I did not even bother turning it on RETURNING IT Had this computer for months Loved it Screen went black and never started up again Tried all the troubleshooter options Just never came back on It worked great at first Then it quit working after a short time Trash laptop the sound is running But we are an epidemic or pandemic sometimes it s handy to zoom with family and friends and I have been able to use it as a research tool As described Quick delivery I love this Hp Chromebook a it is great and it is adorable I absolutely love it it is great for work and school and games love it Chrome os and The laptop arrived earlier that expected I order it Sept and it arrived at Sept The item is also in good condition I will order again Thank you There have been some recent notifications for those that own earlier Chromebooks that updates will discontinue as well as the suspension of the Google Web Store if you have an earlier model you can still use it but without Chromebook updates to the OS Thankfully HP and others have release newer models that utilize SD memory better when used with the standard memory in the Chromebook This particular model will share the gb SD card memory with the Google Play Store apps as well as allowing the user to dedicate memory specific to the Linux development environment If you had an earlier Chromebook configured in development mode and used Crouton with xfce you may have been disappointed with some of the quirks of the Linux desktop if you needed it for applications that weren t available from Google for your Chromebook such as RealVNC for remote desktop applications Thankfully the model allow for more memory for the Linux applications If you do choose to install the KDE desktop I couldn t get Crouton to work make sure you allocate gb rather than the suggested amount since the KDE desktop loads up several apps you may not need including LibreOffice The KDE desktop is very flakey to use but this Chromebook has a separate section for Linux apps that can be executed without loading KDE first without the need for learning a new GUI since this model utilizes virtual memory better between the two operating systems When installing RealVNC this app has to be installed through KDE using the def file through the terminal window Once executed through KDE the shortcut link to app resides in a the Linux app folder so that the separate Linux GUI no longer has to be executed first It took me several hours to figure out the features but it is more reliable for hybrid work environments than the earlier generations used If you use Office One Drive or Nextcloud these apps can be installed through the Google Play Store so that you can use them from your Chromebook as the app rather than through the Chrome web browser if you choose to do so If your phone doesn t have enough room for gaming apps no worries Many of the gaming apps can be downloaded from Google Play and execute from the Chromebook The battery life does last for hours and has better execution and performance than earlier models Like most Chromebooks it is lightweight and doesn t need a great deal of cables plugged into it It does work with Chromecast and is available as an option if the Chromebook sees any on the same network it is connected to This model works with OpenVPN too without file conversion by downloading the app from the Google Play Store and using the nonwindows config files to operate I recommend using the USB GB ethernet adapter from UGreen if you want to be a wired network Those who live in tech areas like Seattle the Bay Area or the the Willamette Valley should know that the best security is wired internet to prevent any snooping over wi fi There is no touchscreen on this model Another thing about this computer is you can download hundreds of Apps There is an App for EVERYTHING Also the port for the mouse was a little bit tight so I had to use a bit of pressure to plug it in but it works just fine This computer meets all my needs I can do everything on it that I did on my laptop The screen is great I can use my mouse and my printer I don t play games on it I can do word processing and spread sheets It is very fast It starts up in seconds and web pages load in seconds I have no complaints I got this Chromebook specifically for learning Spanish while traveling or while at work It is durable and battery life is great The size is great for travel and does everything I need for what Im using it for Sound quality is good too If you need to plug headphones in you can My one beef with this laptop is the screen quality More expesnive laptop tend to have a nice white screen with brightness These chromebooks tend be made of cheaper material and have that horrid blue tint to them Not a fan For the price it s an exceptional computer I enjoy the simplicity of it being a chromebook I m a writer and don t require much It provides me everything I need The battery lasts quite awhile the screen is great quality and it s perfect size weight Omg Better than I thought It is just right for me It came before time and it works great must buy Love this Chromebook Easy to use lightweight and easily portable Bought this to replace an old laptop Since I m retired I didn t need a lot of bells and whistles This does everything I need it to do Just be sure to check the compatibility list for printers on the HP Smart app before buying a new printer Do not depend on the printer descriptions I made that mistake Nice little laptop for the price I m not very tech savvy but it works great for my streaming and stream labs as well at twitch and Netflix etc A small hiccup in shipping but contacted the seller at am and they got back to me at am Handled everything and we re super professional and nice Talk about costumer service Couldn t be happier I really can t accurately rate this item it was a gift delivered to my son in another state What I can say it arrived quickly next day and son says it works good Hard to beat Most quality computer for the money Would buy again The best price on the market I love the waY it works and I love the way it do Bought this for my son s th bday So far he loves it Very good I love it will b back I like how easy it is to use Perfect super great wrapped very good package and excellent my Baby boy loved his Christmas gift This is a great device We love it Best purchase Affordable easy access screen quality Super for the use that is required high school HP inch Chromebook is fast with quick bootup and is to easy to navigate with smooth touchpad Setting adjustments tune Chromebook to your liking and with app store at a touch of an icon many add on apps are available rear speakers give plenty of sound and wifi connection has not so far had any drop outs or lagging Chromebook was given as Christmas gift but stayed in house hold so will see how performance is going foreward I bought this for my daughter due to the pandemic she had to use it for virtual school and it is amazing for price I will definitely purchase again for my other kids Perfect for our kids when doing sch The Graphics are beautiful Would recommend It is a good option for basic and simple tasks as well as for social networks very practical to take anywhere It is perfect for doing school work The battery lasts for approximately to hours As for the size I don t think it s small but I don t think it s big either it s very comfortable to use and perfect for doing work in word processors Excellent for non design architecture or engineering students complies to be able to study Nice device But beware Only an American power connection for the socket is included and the keyboard is American i e qwerty and not like the German qwertz The device is therefore not so practical for children who need the device to learn A very good device I didn t like the American power supply cable Luckily I had a German ready works really well fast delivery arrived in excellent condition thank you Very good laptop it works and looks and feels quality I arrive before the estimated date perfectly packaged it is practical just what my daughter needed for her classes I m a writer and student and use non MS programs so I could not get a Chromebook I also needed a laptop so I had a way to write or research when I was travelling I have a large desktop work computer where most of my work is done I had a similar HP laptop but the keyboard and touch pad went out and I expect that those two things are the weakest link in any laptop Buy a silicon key cover to make the life of your keyboard last but these laptops on average last abut years Another thing that will make the computer last longer is to get a USB mouse to avoid using the track pad About the only difference between the new and the old HPs was that this had G of RAM and the other had G of RAM This Stream is definitely good at not seizing or lurching when you watch a movie or video The other additive that Microsoft has put on this computer is the Windows S It is easy to get out of and there is a toggle to change the program to Windows Home which is more capable of evading corporate MS s iron handed ownership of my computer The instructions are online and they send a large postcard with the computer which also has instructions It is just a matter of going into settings and changing it I do not mind the PC and MS marriage but I do not want a computer that tells me I can only use their programs which happened with Chromebook This one is constantly asking begging me to turn on my Cloud service and turn on other MS Programs I do not do any of that and I do not want to send my work to the cloud When I import it into the big machine I will I like that it has an extra USB port Otherwise it is pretty basic and reminds me of Chromebook which I like but cannot use because of the non MS proprietary writing programs I use As far as using it for entertainment or videos the sound is nice and loud but not blasting the picture is great and it does not buffer endlessly but that may be my internet service My overall opinion is nice It is a good computer for Students or Writers who do not want or need to spend on top of the line equipment Nope this is just a tuck it in the bag and go type computer This runs a little slow but it just may need a memory card to give it a boost It s a beautiful color and it has a clean look My only problem is that it runs a bit slow but it s great for the price This laptop is mainly used for gaming purpose and homework The vaule is good for the money spent The one we got is not touch screen We have had a few small errors of the computer starting and the screen almost acts like it may have a virus on it but I restart it and then have no problems after that It is also good speed computer We have downloaded a few bigger games and it has held up well Bought this laptop for wife to use for work and wasn t sure if it was going to last because of the price but so far we have not had any problems I needed a PC just for internet browsing email and the like For just over delivered this PC fills the bill It may be a refurb but mine looks like new not a scratch or ding anywhere There s a camera but no touchscreen There s Windows it took about an hour to update the year old build It s fast enough for my purposes And it looks good too not nearly as pink as in the pictures I only use my laptop for work and emails very easy setup does exactly what I needed to do do touch screen works perfectly This is my first time purchasing a renewed computer and so far I m very happy with it for the price Wasn t planning on buying this just for the touch screen capability thank god when it arrived I realized it was not touch screen Works great for games that usually slow laptops down though and that s what I ve been using it for This computer shipped fast and securely in a box and was secured with proper packing materials The computer operates great and has no issues Great product Excellent product touch screen for gaming I do not game but for everyday use I have found this laptop to be excellent I love this laptop The size is great it s in perfect condition I would highly recommend this And Pink light weight easy to use I like the slim design of the HP Laptop Its very light no extra battery to replace Easy to do work on battery life is excellent so far Screen quality is great sound quality is also very nice I love mine The laptop is light and very sleek It doesn t run slow It keeps up with my speed and easy to connect to wifi and add bluetooth devices I play games sometimes and it doesn t lag FYI No this is not touch screen The laptop came with the charger I ve had it for about two months So far so good I don t use it for gaming or anything like that Just needed something to build my portfolio and for social media This computer is sleek modern looking I only use it for chrome and Google drive documents may need open at a time It loads sooooo painfully slow that I almost can t do what I need to do So you get what you paid for But the color is cute Very easy to use Quite fast Excellent for the money Just what I wanted in a laptop able to stream videos play games and browse the computer and also do some online computer work Great laptop and a terrific price I am very pleased with my laptop Delivery was prompt and the laptop was in excellent condition It was very easy to set up For the price it s a great deal As functional as it is beautiful It was delivered on time in great condition and works perfect the set up took a minute or two and it was just setting up my preferences everything installed and downloaded in seconds A great buy When the computer arrived I carefully took it out and tried to power it on it didn t turn on so I placed it on the charger for mins to an hour and it still wouldn t power on After further investigating the issue I noticed that the light didn t even come on whenever I had it plugged in charging I thought maybe something happened to my outlet I had it plugged into so I tried four more different outlets throughout my house Still no light came on indicating that it was getting power to it to charge It had a sticker on the box as seen in one of the picture that I took that the computer had been tested for full functions and was ready for reuse That s a lie I m highly disappointed and I would not recommend this to anyone Save yourself the time and trouble and avoid this product exellent product good quality I love the touch screen the most Lol but overall great investment The computer works just fine but I cant activate Windows due to no windows product key Love this computer Work great Love the color I didn t know it was touch screen pleasantly surprised Easy to start up walks you right through start up Great price I received this laptop in great condition however it didn t come with a charging cable My only option was to return the entire thing get a replacement or buy a cord separately I didn t see anywhere on the product description that a charging cord was not included and I saw other customer photos that included it I m annoyed that I ll have to pay for one separately or go through the hassle or returning and recording it I bought this with the premise of it being a good price and touchscreen Turns out it was too good to be true That other review was a lie and it does not have touchscreen no matter how many settings I download videos I watch or updates I complete They lied to most of us or they re just selling different computers in the same pretty in pink color Low cost Works good Would buy again It s great Better than my old one Great for the money spent Haven t used much yet Disappointed because this wasn t touchscreen However Customer Service and tech support is very good tech read many test and confirmed it wasn t touchscreen either but still this is not a touch screen They sent a replacement swiftly and still wasn t a touchscreen but they were fast paid shipping paid return paid freed pickup from home and quick refund Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed They shouldn t advertise it as touchscreen though I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for If you don t need touchscreen than this can be a great computer for you Looks like picture too My laptop stopped working exactly months after purchase Never will purchase another refurbished pc First and last Avoid refurbished Nothing is able to be saved on this computer I m returning it Recommend DI NOT BUY I love the color the screen looks excellent but it is too slow I got this laptop based on reviews and knowing it was refurbished Very upsetting because I had saved all my passwords and documents already While I was working it would pause and restart by itself out of nowhere see pics It happened multiple times This last time the screen wouldn t come back and I had to turn off and turn on again Not reliable I had it for a week only I will be returning this I spent extra and got a brand new one Too risky At first it was taking forever mins and a blank screen to log in I was ready to take it back Then I tried to update and restart then it started up right away Hopefully this can handle my daughter s first year of college So far not bad for price The tose gold is a plus as it matches her dorm decor Arrived like new Touch screen laptop however touchscreen does not work was a little disappointed but it is still a great value for what i paid It is a great little laptop I love finding these great buys in the refurbished renewed shop Really good laptop light weight fast good for gaming Great product Thanks This is not a touch screen computer It doesn t say it in the description The comments made me think so It came in perfect condition basically brand new A little slow but very worth it I ve had this now for two months and it literally is such an amazing laptop for the price it s literally a steel I love it It came fast and very easy access to set up and transfer Easy set up and love the color Great purchase Was a little scared at first to get but I m happy I did To replace a later hp laptop Needed something smaller More for ME I m very satisfied Not a single scratch or issue Beautiful color also This product came in impeccable condition I was a tad bit surprised that the color popped so nicely The system runs very well I am very impressed with this lightweight laptop as I travel a great deal for business Great computer USB ports HDMI extra storage slot Battery lasts a very long time I have Windows which works great i bought this laptop for my husband and he loves it great value for the money This was a great buy It s a keeper for sure Price can t be bet Needed a new laptop for the Wife and this refurbished HP laptop has filled the bill It came with Windows which seemed to work well Had no trouble with setup It is lightweight and for a refurbished item it looked brand new My wife just uses it for communication and light gaming It does not have enough memory to be a heavy gaming machine It does not come with a CD DVD player I use flash drives to transfer data and programs A star buy I needed a new laptop computer just for general use and this one from Amazon seemed like it would do the job So far I ve been very pleased with the machine I ve been using it for web browsing using Chrome and some general light computing work and it has worked great I like the screen a lot Text is clear and easy to read and x resolution is plenty for a screen of this size It has been bright enough to use outside when I was working on setting up some networking equipment for a friend The keyboard and track pad both feel nice and work well I wish the little bumps that identify the home row keys were a little bit larger but overall it is pretty good I have another GB of ram ordered so that I can have GB by just adding another card Yesterday I upgraded the memory to GB using a Crucial CT G SFRA A This plugged right in but in order to install the extra stick of memory I had to remove the back from the computer I had to take out about screws and then carefully pry off the back using a plastic spudger All done with no problems but access could be easier This is my first machine with the Windows operating system Out of the box and in day to day use it has been very good Adding my printers applications and other stuff has been painless sleep waking up and overall power management has all worked well The computer didn t come with a huge amount of crapware to remove either There were a few things like some McCafee stuff but nothing excessive I have not pushed the battery life all that much but so far it has been very adequate for my needs I ve liked the machine well enough to order another one for a family member who needs a new Windows PC So far so good after a couple of weeks and well worth the money If you can afford go for this one I ve tried getting cheaper computers on Amazon One was which didn t work and I it had to be returned The second was and that didn t work and had to be returned I found when I ve set those computers up that both of them had that software last loaded early in This HP computer had a software loaded in a few months prior to the time that I bought it So it s windows is up to date It s other software is up to date The microphone and the screen works perfectly If you need a new computer and your uses are simple and you just need it to reliably work Get this HP It s perfect It s fine It Works I did not need Customer Support to remote in and remove software and then reload it I zoom four hours a day and boots up and goes It was great out of the box This doesn t have touch screen on my model The FHD display really surprised me It s better picture than a lot of these TVs As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later As soon as the th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it s got a burnt pixel No way to fix that without replacing the screen Unless you have burned out pixels good luck getting a return or any repairs HP is still shady in that regard I fully upgraded the machine when I got it GB ram TB Samsung SSD The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects I have a Geforce an octocore AMD CPU and GB DDR ram in my tower This laptop of course has a little less RAM but it plays games about just as well as on my tower I really am surprised at this The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a CM gap There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine but there just isn t room They couldn t even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately I had problems with HP in the past they screwed up a laptop return I sent in then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures so I m not shocked at how they treat customers I swore I d not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up It s super light weight The camera is nothing fancy in Windows you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options It s instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers You ll also want to get a good set of headphones The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out The machine simply wasn t designed properly and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a cm gap When you close the lid and open it after minutes you ll find it s incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI It forces you to keep the screen open which isn t good to have static screens I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat but there isn t anything I can do about it It isn t that bad but once you see something you can never unsee it I have a warranty but again it s not going to cover this damage so I spent money and not even days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen The case is the cheapest plastic they could find Given this was produced during the pandemic you re left with another problem Check your RAM speeds If you get stuck with a R chip you re basically having librarian trying to organize shelves whereas the good ram R would be equal to librarians keeping up with shelves Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine They don t mention this in their sales page or documentation and you ll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it or pull the machine apart Overall I probably wouldn t buy this machine again even though it works fast for an entry level computer It s just too poorly designed I give it a year or two before it fails Most likely knowing HP it will be minutes after the OEM warranty expires They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers and even though it s been nearly years since I swore I wouldn t buy another one they changed for the worse Ok so overall this laptop is a decent practical all around laptop Not great but good enough If you re a deal hunter and are good at what you do I guarantee you can find better If you re like me don t have time to scout the internet and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation then it s possible at some point you re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you ll accept only being reasonably happy with it aka I settled Here is my observation of each aspect of the laptop The screen quality is good but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough so I m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment The battery life is ok lasting me about hours currently We will see how long that keeps up as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about years The keys feel good to type on which I was relieved to find The speed of the laptop is only alright For an SSD I expected it to be faster This machine will stream video just fine but don t plan on doing any video editing or gaming The weight is actually very nice but that should be expected with such a small screen One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot which I like Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan but this computer does not need that I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm Lastly and unfortunately the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings But after doing so I realized it is not a software issue The problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough So in effect what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad That is fine when you re moving the cursor large distances across the screen but it means that fine small movements are difficult to achieve It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this Luckily I came up with a solution You will need to order a touchpad cover skin for They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface This worked well The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size Here are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks

taps touchpad sensitivity high sensitivity That s all I ve got Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them So this was the first non high end gaming laptop I ve ever purchased with the intent of using it as a cheap laptop to carry around for school work and general basic use To be quite honest it s surprisingly nice After I got over the initial shock of downgrading to a display from my previous the screen is of good quality The processing speed is not disappointing at all The sound is great it actually can get obnoxiously loud if you are into that I don t find Windows to be offensive to use Keyboard is friendly It seems to be built well and feels of decent quality not super cheap feeling It s light to carry Loads videos and webpages quickly No crashing or general use issues as of yet I ve even run the full Adobe Creative Suite on this thing and it s running just fine I m really pleasantly surprised And coming from someone who is used to a k Alienware Gaming Laptop aka me the fact that I don t hate this thing is truly impressive enough If you pressed me to find something I don t love about it I d say the fan seems to run more than expected and the battery life is meh It gives you zero warning before just shutting off after dying But after the panic subsided that I had just possibly lost all my work I plugged it in and hit the power button only to be giddy with happiness that it just booted up with all my web pages still loaded and logged in the way I left it So I am not even mad No touch screen on my model And I can t attest to it s gaming abilities because well I have an Alienware for that Seriously though best spent ever I like how lightweight it is the ram is upgradeable so is the SSD drive I have always been partial to HP my last computers have been HP s I find them to be reliable and I am hoping this one is too It drains the battery faster than I would like but it could be my settings I will keep you all posted Thank you Amazon Additional Findings A month in and this is what I discovered When I ordered this laptop I had two things in mind One is a backup computer for my desktop I use it for my entertainment system it is partly a backup Plex Server It works great by the way Two I wanted something lightweight that I could take with me to a coffee shop and do whatever as I enjoy my coffee outdoors No complaints so far I have since tweaked my battery settings and have literally increased my battery life by about times between recharges Go to YouTube and look up how to extend battery life on an HP Laptop and you will find helpful tips I have no heat problem what so ever some people have complained about that I upgraded the memory to gigs and it is fast as all get out So hence my rating stays a star Keep in mind it is made of plastic be gentle if you wish to upgrade on your own don t be a bull in a China shop Yes before you ask you can hook it up to a large monitor and close the lid it is in Windows settings when in doubt YouTube is my go to I hope this helps I am happy to answer questions if I can Understand what you are buying and how you want to use the product and have fun Great laptop If it seems good to me so far there is no volume just on the speakers jj This laptop did surprise me The Ryzen mobile CPU is rather good and the GB of RAM that it comes with is more than sufficient if you only plan on doing simple tasks office work watching videos on video websites etc I was surprised to see next to no bloatware on my machine though this could be due to the fact they do only give you a GB SSD There is an expansion slot for a SD Micro SD card but the laptop does have an additional slot for another stick of RAM and you can swap out the included SSD with an upgraded one provided you know how to do it or know someone that can do it If you upgrade to GB of RAM for dual channel mode and get a high performant SSD then you get a lot more performance since Ryzen processors often work better with dual channel memory This is essential if you want to do any medium gaming on this laptop I upgraded mine and I love it even more GOOD QUALITY Amazing battery life Fast Ryzen processor Comes with gb ram but I added one more gb for Runs butter smooth Best value at this price point this is a good cheap laptop for doing various activities however gaming is a very poor experience on this laptop i dont know why it is marketed for gaming as it can barely hit frames at on most games i assume you could run some very light indie games or super well optimised games on it but anything that requires any kind of gpu power forget about it i will still give stars tho because it does everything i need it to and does it well good battery life i usually get at least hours of use out of it per charge I m very happy with this laptop I ve had it like weeks now and I ve used it every single day It arrived very quickly It s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs homework web browsing to even some gaming I ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested but even just with the gb I ve been able to run some lower spec games Games like Sims city Bethesda games age of empires ALMOST everything I ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles Whether you re looking for a cheaper option for playing games don t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings a school laptop or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on this is a good contender for the price The only reasons I didn t give it stars are the external hardware is nothing fancy not bad quality just could be better the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast and the material the track pad is made of is not that great Other than that I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop EDIT I have had it for like months now I still love it and all of this still remains true I have played some better games on it as well such as Ready or Not and Arma Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions Arma runs like a charm of the time In single player you van even run on ultra graphics for an FPS trade off I run the CPU pretty hard sometimes and it does pretty well at keeping up Needed a new laptop and this was just what I needed Easy to set up and it loads quickly I bought this for my Nephew He likes it a lot but he is a writer and he had to install and pay for a word program I don t know why laptops don t offer something simple for writing purposes Other than that he is pleased with the laptop This computer seems to work fine I thought from the photos it had an SD card reader but it just has a slot for one so I have to use a separate card reader Excellent performance for daily tasks banks online procedures downloading and editing files etc Great contribution of bluetooth connectivity excellent wifi speed Very fast in everything Great price for this purchase Satisfied customer Excellent team Virtually everything they offer however does not have the Backlit keyboard as it says in the characteristics for sale They should take care of that detail for the rest it is very fast I love the screen excellent quality and the battery has a great duration This is a great computer for the value and I am happy with the purchase but when the computer arrived it was missing the prong connector jack for the plug to outlet Please take note as I had to wait another two days and purchase this part If you plan on using this outside it may not be bright enough Bought this laptop specifically for school It s great and not so big that it doesn t fit on my desk that holds my work stuff The screen brought a detail A light point that is noticeable when the background is dark The battery does not last more than four hours and it has a problem that I think is a configuration problem that does not let me place the accent I make the adjustments in language I restart it and everything is fine After two minutes it comes back with the same problem I feel disappointed I don t know how to request a change because I bought it from Venezuela I bought this for general use as well as photo editing I know there are more robust laptops and PC s out there but I didn t want to spend a ton This laptop is very good for the price It starts up quickly and handles apps with no problems I do not play games on it so I cannot tell you how it runs those I do have Lightroom and Photoshop on it and it handled those very well out of the box I did however add GB of RAM to the laptop and Lightroom and Photoshop do REALLY well now No issues whatsoever I didn t know how I d feel about the Ryzen processor but it does a fabulous job With the added memory I don t think there s anything this laptop won t handle Note If you are going to add RAM to this laptop BEWARE You have to remove the entire bottom panel including removing the glued on grip pads When you remove these they may or may not come off cleanly meaning they may not go back on the way they were without some glue or repair Just be extremely careful in removing them This may be the best option available for less than as of February It has decent battery life hours good performance it s portable and upgradable if you are skilled careful Perfect for a student or for business use You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse office work watch movies etc Be prepared to deal with Windows sigh and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU s and Windows brilliant fan control Overall I recommend it I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads However I am familiar with upgrading and repairs This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding I m happy thus far My only gripe is the screen The refresh rate is noticeably low with media viewing Netflix The AMD Ryzen chip gives this laptop great performance and battery life Both the CPU and especially the built in GPU perform very well Also it really doesn t get hot nor draw much battery during operation A very good performing inexpensive laptop overall For what it is it s pretty good a ryzen with an SSD and a fhd screen for is honestly impressive I hate the fact that windows was installed by default so I moved to Fedora Linux as soon as I was to I haven t tried any gaming but I can confidently say it won t run much Definitely a better choice than a chromebook I loved everything about this laptop It was great until I went to turn it on the other day and though the light indicating it was starting up went on it quickly went off and it has not worked since Since it is a laptop I was advised it would be cheaper to buy a new one rather than fix this one Very disappointed I never really take my laptop anywhere so I never really rely on it for on the go I ve bought this so I can run emulators on my laptop and the limit of this pc seems to be The ps emulator so everything before it should run fine That s for people that care about that but overall a solid Investment for me I bought this for my granddaughter who is a Sophomore in high school because she is taking computer graphics courses She really likes it We needed a computer that was light and portable for school This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for and we bought it and a additional stick of ram It works well performance is plenty But the Negative and why it doesn t get stars The feet are small starving it for air even when raising it the fan loves to spin up way too loud and waay to often A laptop cooler rectified this issue but for a low power laptop not impressed with the cooling Screens OK nothing special which that s this laptop top to bottom OK nothing special I d definitely but another but I might pull apart and check the thermal compound put some higher quality compound on it and see if it helps It s a basic laptop that you can use for work Comes with Windows and you then buy Office It s really lightweight almost exactly as light as the MacBook Air So if you don t want to spend a lot on a laptop and you only use it for basic stuff like Office YouTube and web surfing and you are not too finicky about specs then it s a great choice The AMD Ryzen is pretty fast kinda faster than Intel IMO HP has a home run with the average non gaming user Just wanted a quick boot up and won t burn my legs laptop at a reasonable price Rips through all my programs with ease I am very satisfied I bought this laptop for my kids so they could do homework and it works really good No issues so far Pretty quick Exactly what I expected Perfect size and power for what I need Good looking unit too Seller was very accommodating too Good specs for this mid level laptop Perfect for my kid heading off to college It has all that is needed except maybe an additional upgrade in RAM needed in the next year or two I wish the keys lit up The whole keyboard seems rickety and not very sturdy It will do for now but I regret not buying another MacBook My son wanted a gaming laptop for his birthday He enjoys Minecraft Roblox and some Steam games I didn t want to invest in a laptop built specifically for gaming quite yet but this had specs that I felt would work for his interests I also followed a reviewer s advice and instructions by the way that review deserves a gold medal to acquire and install another stick of RAM to bring it up to g Not gonna lie I narrowly avoided a heart attack while removing the bottom plate of the laptop but it really was a pretty easy process to give an upgrade that lets my son play the heavier Steam games without lag He is very happy and so is my wallet Its good for basic gaming but anything like vr or final fantasy will not be playable unless you take out the entire motherboard and get a new one so you might as well get a better more expensive laptop because thats gonna cost about the same Add another compatible GB RAM about and upgrade to a fast TB TB NVMe SSD I play Fallout with a mix of med to mostly high settings with no lag I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows as my desktop could not be upgraded So far for the budget price it was a good choice so I m not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows My opinion on Win is still out I gifted this for my daughter who is a gamer and builder I wanted to give this Laptop starts but the battery life is no good In just mins I lose battery power even when it runs on balanced Overall a great and powerful little computer Lightweight and excellent screen quality Do I recommend buying Yes My grand son picked it out As suits well for UTC I do shirt design and am a college student so I definitely use my computer a lot this computer functions well and is pretty fast The battery last me maybe hours and is very lightweight It s not touch screen but other then that decent and fast Best priced laptop AMAZING battery life and quick charge You get everything you want in a simple but powerful computer without having to pay for the premium of a top brand name or the premium of an Intel Chip Thing works just fine one glitch is I have to often restart my laptop takes like seconds max to initially connect to my WiFi maybe an easy fix I d recommend this laptop I just want to know how to fix the reboot issue Highly recommend My son has been begging for a laptop for gaming and has a bday coming up big This laptop has good specs and we upgraded the ram to gb up to gb The hard drive can be upgraded up to tb The price is budget friendly This laptop runs steam and GTA without issues Pro quick seems well built for the price value for money Cons no fingerprint reader I assume the IR camera replaces this but not my liking dim screen need to add extra stick of GB RAM to get all the performance off the CPU Speedy and powerful I can finally play Genshin Impact Great battery life and fast to update with a lot of storage The internet reception isn t very good on it though The equipment arrived in good condition and performs i had this laptop for few months let me tell you this laptop is the best bang for the buck when i first got it it had everything i needed in a laptop I got it for the main purpose to use it on the go when i am not at the office however after few months i started noticing that every time i turned it on the battery is dead which makes the laptop unusable especially for the purpose i got it for this week i made sure to charge it to and turned it off so it is ready to be used when i needed it in case of emergency to my surprise when i turned it on after few days the battery was at completely drained while the laptop was off Good value for money works as described Good fast delivery The only problem I have is that the processing is not as good with windows the rest of the PC is fine it s light it s ryzen I do realize that I needed a graphic card though I got this for school as an online college student and I love it So far I ve only had it a few days but it works great It runs fast I love that the keys are big and don t on them It s lightweight and the screen is a good size All and all I m very pleased The idle cpu was quite high when I first got it Still is even after some tweaking perfect screen and my games work fine Produst was as expected but I ordered laptops and only one came with shipment Had to find out why and apparently warehouse only had one but there was no communication so daughter happy and other disappointed as we had to order a different one from another seller Refund was quick though I am very pleased with this laptop overall I opted for the Windows version and find it to be what I wanted in this type of computer I find the lack in number of USB ports to be a downer but a quality USB hub I use UGREEN products will fix that shortfall I am adding additional memory to the unit my folly Recommend Really good specs for a laptop I did purchase another stick of gb ram not too bad to install just be patient when removing bottom panel Cinebench score of which for a mobile processor is not bad Plan on using with an external monitor external keyboard external mouse for CPA business tax work Cheaper than buying a small form factor desktop Bought this to replace my last HP laptop that died So far I m impressed Bought this for simple audio recording and it is amazing for that It is very snappy out of the box but I did upgrade it with another gig stick of ram for future proofing I would wholly suggest it for any type of workstation duties I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen I d be lying if I said I don t miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake I thought it was a touchscreen it is not It s a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for So far so good So far I have had no problems The speed is good I have a second memory card that I haven t installed yet but will soon As fast as it is now I can only imagine how much better it will be Will give another update later Excellent quality price Everything came fine box was sealed and undamaged but when it was opened I notice this huge scratches at the back Somewhat displeased because I know this is a new system but now it feels like a used device Thanks Very sleek and light weight Love it This laptop is really good and fast I just upgraded the ram gb to gb crucial ram and also tb sss crucial Now this thing is butter Good to buy I had doubts about the AMD processor used to Intel for a long time but it is super fast the battery lasts many hours It is not tactile but the colors of the screen are great Comes with Windows Touch screen nice Just the right stuff for home and student I tried to like this laptop I love how lightweight it is and the screen is pretty good it gets bright enough The CPU is also very fast for everyday use and streaming videos However there are two issues I have encountered One the wifi reception is very poor I have another Lenovo Legion laptop that gets full wifi signal anywhere in the house even far away from the modem while this HP laptop gets very very weak signal if I am moderately far from the modem second issue this laptop gets too hot even while doing relatively minor tasks but the problem gets worse while it s plugged in the fans go crazy and both the laptop and the AC adapter overheat Overall I wouldn t recommend this laptop As for as a laptop that is all it is The headphone jack stopped working after months The battery is meh it drains pretty quickly if the laptop is off or in sleep It takes forever to turn on I legitimately thought it was broken when I first received it because of that It also takes forever to come out of sleep The review mentioned a touch screen I don t think it has one If it does mine does not work Battery life not as long as stated Laptop feels cheaper made thany last laptop Screen quality seems good Had a HP laptop and this one lacks some features but is smaller and lighter weight good display and keyboard It was amazing I loved how fast it was to set up a very cheap laptop for gaming Fast processor quality in materials well built Everything is good Really like it Very useful and maneuverable equipment comfortable to work Love it Very satisfied This laptop is amazing As you can see in the image the screen presents this problem and it is more visible when the background is white or light I have not used a lot this laptop and it started to present this problem for some reason This computer is complete TRAAASH Don t walk RUN Keeps restarting and black screen every mins DO NOT RECOMMEND HP needs to do better with their products This computer literally disconnects it s self from the internet every minutes and I m not even exaggerating In a hour day I experienced minutes of solid fast internet the rest of the time is just slow constantly buffering disconnecting and reconnecting I ve tried everything updated everything made sure no power saver is turning it off no metal is near the laptop and after extensive research I can t get anything close to answer because all the answers provided don t actually work I can t even check my email without it disconnecting times Trash absolute trash and I m certainly returning this worthless computer because what good is a computer for streaming if it can t stay connected Got this Working fine for a few weeks But then I started getting the blue screen of death Got a replacement computer through the great assistance from Prime Member s customer support Got the replacement today and brand new but during the setup I got that same blue screen message Moving on and away from HP and non Intel processors for a while Computer worked great then went to open it up and turn it on and it doesn t work days old the battery won t charge to full The laptop is fine but I m deducting a star because the keyboard is not backlit I own three very similar HP latptops purchased through Costco over the past two years The Costco laptops were Intel powered i and i machines with the same nits FHD screens SSDs and backlit keyboards This unit is very similar however it is AMD powered and the keyboard is not backlit I tried my best to ensure that it was however I could not confirm on the web So let me be the first to confirm it is not I needed a smaller computer My desktop took up too much space on my desk while working from home This laptop has been great I can put it away when not being used and put it in my bag and take it with me when traveling for work I would buy it again After seeing so many rough reviews I was a bit skeptical myself but no worries this laptop is lovely I m months in and currently typing up this review on it The keyboard is fantastic and satisfying The mousepad is super responsive and has even a left and right side that have different features Although the screen is not my favorite it still works well This computer performs magically but I do recommend installing extra ram onto this to rock its full potential Overall beastly computer take my word for it Got this for my daughter after all of the chromebooks in the house died It s the perfect size weight and has enough spec to run all of her games and schoolwork She loves it Good deal This was purchased for my daughter and she LOVES IT Fast and great features Thanks I m glad I tried this laptop It gave me an appreciation for my year old model that has more speed and memory I returned it knowing that I should buy at least an equivalent replacement I m not a gamer and I have spent hours fixing touch screen problems I bought it because it came without a touch screen and without enough gaming power I was looking for updated features but didn t find any Pretty much the same ol wrapped in pretty Windows screens The price was perfect for the quality The narrow margin anti glare screen is beautiful The camera doesn t support the Windows hello feature Start up is much slower than I expected Without the experience of higher end machines this is a great choice All good I ended up returning it because it doesn t have an ethernet port I didn t know that not all computers have one It seemed like it would be a great computer for a casual user This is the first time I used an AMD processor and I m pleased Works great Love the light weight and awesome quality Easy to travel with Fast processor Better than dell I like the size of this computer It is lightweight There is no touch screen I purchased for work at home position and does a good job of keeping up with many programs open at one time Battery life is an issue as it does not give you the full eight hours as described I m only able to get half that battery life I purchased this so that I could have my original HP worked on with additional memory and Bluetooth I think this one will work fine until that is complete The keyboard is great and I love that it is raised This far it does what I need I absolutely don t like that you have to log into Microsoft to set up I also do not need the app feature and find that most laptops and windows are going that route It s annoying Other than those issues for the money it is thus far doing the job I ve only had this laptop a couple of days but I really like it I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop Ok a little update I do like this laptop a lot I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn t work right out of the box I m dumbfounded by these reviews The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself This device had a defective battery out of the box I didn t notice that until after a few days I contacted H P and they were great to work with They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good H P offered to replace the battery free but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop They weren t game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it Well being the kind of person I am I went to my favorite retailer Amazon ordered the proper battery replaced the dead one and now I have a great laptop with a good battery I would still give it a star review and recommend it to anyone This was a great but for price paid Great display responsive keyboard plenty of storage It s quick to boot up and smoothly opens programs with unnoticeably wait time You ll wanna buy one for everyone in your household It is a good product but with very light materials you have to take good care of it Quick and it doesn t fry I love it Excellent item I m happy I bought it This isn t compatible with the pricey HP Thunderbolt G dock Not sure why a chromebook is but HP to HP won t Also I bought this Amazon used and the warranty was activated and only had months left Product itself seems nice though very fast i truly like did have one issue when starting to downloads origin for Sims but i found a forum from EA and fixed it It should ve already been installed and up to date as a gamer pc however it was used and i think cleared so anyway it was easy to fix once i researched The laptop is working excellently I ve been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference This is the fastest one I ve ever owned I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books This notebook is too great to use for just that Can t say enough good things about it I bought this for my private practice and it works great Does not have a bunch of bell and whistles but it meets my needs since this is what I leave at the office Analogue Better than a flip phone or Google phone but it s not a new iPhone I am very happy with it It runs faster than I expected which was my biggest concern I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop days ago including the no wifi reviews I actually thought that I wont get one of those but I did and since no one had said that HP has a fix I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance so far Well I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a way call HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp fix the issue once I was on wifi they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue and the laptop in general for a permanent wifi fix this all via the wifi connection and they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently so for now I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place Also after watching what the tech did remotely a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers But again we shouldnt have to do that last note I also have a year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member it has been bulletproof since day one I hope to do and say the same about this one in years minus this incident Is a good pc to work and watching movies but not for playing games Nice laptop works as expected It forgets the internet easily if you leave your location and come back so keep your eye out for that Other than that there is not much to complain about I was expecting something more mettalic heavy but feels like a Asus talking about the body Otherwise performance is good Feels smooth and responsive I ve got the issue with the WiFi driver and Windows but fixed looking and searching on the web HP support didn t help me at all I didn t like that the keyboard is not backlight Also it gets very overheated fast I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing I believe that the bloatware was interfering with it I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail It does work fine now The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long may explain in part the quick charging I am now completely satisfied Honestly I know absolutely NOTHING about computers I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like that didn t even connect to the internet In senior year of high school we had chrome books and those were so simple to use When I got this computer it was intimidating and I struggled to figure it out BUT even without support of microsoft amazon or hp I was able to fix the error code myself The screen display is beautiful bright and perfect for me I can t wait to see how it does for my college courses and sims I recommend it It s a perfect size and VERY sleek girllllll or guy I won t discriminate lol When judging this laptop always keep the price in mind First the cons Is it a gaming computer No the graphics adapter isn t intended for that purpose Is the housing suitable for those e g children who toss around electronics without regard for their durability No it is cheap plastic Don t buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes The matte screen isn t the brightest The sound quality isn t immersive There is no optical drive Now the pros The price This is a laptop with Windows Even though the laptop isn t for gaming I have used Adobe cs software with no issues Premiere Pro Photoshop Audition Rendering video isn t super speedy but it isn t unreasonable I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs and didn t buy it for that purpose as I have another computer for it but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise Who should buy this laptop Anyone who wants a light weight computer for school travel or home on which they can use email stream video take notes browse the internet or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro As a sidenote I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog Google Chrome but I have not installed it If you do a lot of browsing and who doesn t then I would suggest looking at other browsers such as Vivaldi I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using so it is not specific to this laptop LOL to the one star reviews from people who can t connect to Wi Fi or used to some other brand and can t figure out HP It s a computer You have to either know how to use it learn how to use it or buy support I ve had this computer for months and yes yesterday I couldn t connect to Wi Fi Blamed it on this laptop and wondered if I had purchased a warranty I didn t Started reading the reviews But then I tried figuring out why my Wi Fi isn t connecting via my cell phone It took a while I learned a lot of computer innards and after successfully connecting to Wi Fi I m typing this review from it Wi Fi problem had nothing to do with laptop The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program This laptop is great Superfast Pages load instantly something I wasn t used to with my previous laptops Plenty of space for all my stuff in the form of photos videos family trees and also my husband s business programs logs documents and files I m very happy we bought it so therefore star review Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi this needs to be addressed I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck deal I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless I have had no such issues nor any other issues Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally I find I never have to wait on it to do anything It boots up faster than any previous PC I ve had Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it Very pleased with this product Wife has no complaints and computer functions quite well Great price Excellent performance My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me That said I bought it for my children to use so might not be a problem Picked this up for my year old dad Very fast machine nice and light Trackpad clicking isnt as smooth as more expensive machines and keyboard feel is just ok Would totally get again if on sale I use this HP Laptop for personal use as well as for my Prayer Group duties I maintain membership lists as well as other related lists I create ads for our events and send them via email to our rectory for insertion in the church s bulletin Our other HP Laptop has been in use for these purposes since Since my husband has been using the other laptop more frequently writing novels I decided to get one for myself This way I have access whenever I want it I fully expect this Laptop to serve me as well as the older one did I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school I needed something quickly but I wanted quality I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes I am so happy with my purchase Setup was a breeze it took maybe minutes and maybe an extra for the updates The picture is crisp and clear it has great sound the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read I purchased the windows version and have no regrets I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in With the exception of heavy gaming I can t imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn t be able to do for work or for school I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it All our programs are cloud hosted so we didn t need anything super powerful This laptop is actually overkill for accessing our web based program and Microsoft but we bought these for longevity over any i The i models just don t last as long and tend to get slow much sooner than this i model Dozens purchased no issues so far Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn t hold a charge longer than minutes After five months the laptop won t work unless plugged in I don t do a lot of gaming but it s great for Microsoft email and shopping The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are Until I learned where the end key was for instance I struggled to see it Still it s a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for Works well with Teams video quality is ok but I m not using it for gaming Only HMDI port which is kind of annoying when you d like to connect it to multiple monitors Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi which is inconvenient to put it mildly when you need to be online for work Other than that it s an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it s supposed to This is feedback from my Daughter who I had it sent to as a gift HP is typically good equipment The components and spec in the AD appear to be a solid unit for it s intended purpose I ll send an update upon hearing further information Computer works well and seems a good value Enjoy Windows Had one glitch when it dropped internet and struggled to get reconnected Thought we might have either software or hardware issue Did finally get it back but normally it would be an easy reconnect just by finding a viable WiFi signal Not the case If it occurs again we ll deal with HP to see if we have a hardware issue reason for a star rating Otherwise it was easy to set up and connect with printer and monitor And it s really lightweight so easy to travel with in my backpack We bought this computer to replace one that was irredeemable It has an i Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i I am not sure why the speed has increased but we like it a whole lot better The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on hours a day This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters we do not search the web or receive e mails The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the year extended warranty which I was told included tech support We had a lot of problems with the last laptop and needed tech support which was only good for one year By the way it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft updated my windows and then the computer stopped working I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they updated my computer and asked if they would fix it They said they would be glad to fix it for a charge At that point I was loud and angry I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware You screwed up my computer and for you will fix it I said I would not pay such ransom ware money I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing They did and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the automatic update button I did just that and for years I loved my computer again An update to my review the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus for a restocking charge No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you A further update on my refund The seller Tech Deals Store is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack I have asked for a full refund and am awaiting their answer If I don t receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund If that doesn t work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam Further update Amazon gave me the back I hope I remember the name Tech Deals Store and never buy from these people again I purchased this to replace my year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing social media emailing photo retouching and Word powerpoint excel projects This HP is everything I needed and more Windows is much more user friendly than Windows The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal It starts up quick and holds a charge for at least hours Best of all it s lightweight and thin so traveling is a breeze Bonus it is bluetooth compatible so I can make answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room Another bonus numeric keypad The only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back lit keyboard but I m not sweating the small stuff I don t have any issue with the screen display and no issue connecting to Microsoft account and store It worked right out of the box I just have to set up some things before the first use The keyboard could have a backlit display for use at night time tho The keyboard itself is a little bit confusing because it has so many buttons that are unnecessary people don t use that much of extra things that s on this keyboard The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho I am happy with it I don t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube I don t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience Everyone has their own preference The only suggestion I have is to buy your laptop directly from Amazon not from marketplace sellers If you need to customize your laptop specifications I suggest you buy from bestbuy and from the manufacturers Happy shopping For this price this laptop is amazing I use this for gaming and college and it runs great Very durable and can run bigger games like sims and castlevania My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst and I m working remotely To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false I m able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues In my spare time I also do music using Soundtrap I plug a USB keyboard and microphone guitar interface into this laptop and I m able to create multi track songs My caps lock does have an indicator light that works and I have zero complaints or issues Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model I purchased mine in February of and the OS is Windows Home Actually I bought One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp The laptops are great and we have no complaints its light weight and the keys are large and easy to press comes with windows installed and its a fast booter and runs smooth perfect and will do the job This laptop is very responsive very fast i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy I find it sturdy The only problem with it is the keyboard without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit the letters are etched over silver keys very hard to read them I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop Other wise a very good laptop Let me preface this by saying I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have interviews I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for interviews using Microsoft office suite using my cricut and he found this computer for me It arrived in day and was easy to set up I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching The battery life is great it s light weight and is pretty fast when loading programs I have zero complaints There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn t know it came with one if it does so I ll try that and edit my review Overall I m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse Laptop looks new No scratches or marks Runs smoothly after three months I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse I just needed a computer for home use and this one fit the bill I bought it refurbished and I couldn t be happier Perfect condition and no issues equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price It s nice Had issues w it not staying connected to the WiFi though Had to tamper w the bios to get it to finally work i love the SSD and the I not too crazy about windows Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos exe But I love the computer especially the boot time seconds It is light easy to use and install I bought it for my daughter for college and she loves it I bought this for school to make digital art and animation It works well for those purposes but I ve honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games Pretty much everything from like PS era and before can run at high settings fairly stably I don t think it can even launch most newer triple A games so I haven t even tried The screen is bright and easy to view however the keypad is difficult to view unless you have light right on top of the computer The keys are labeled in silver with the overall keyboard also in silver I had to call in a professional I T person to set up the computer Windows created major problems for him and took him hours of research to solve the problems especially with the HP printer and he has been working with computers for over years Pro Good price Nice size easy to handle light weight good battery life Con Dull screen Not enough brightnrss If I knew this is how the screen is going to look I would have not purched this laptop This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there s a learning process I m using it to start working at home My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys Great I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker disable the TPM and jettison Windows I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough It really should have an ethernet port too but at least it was cheap Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available I am still experimenting with this little girl but I am very pleased I do not game so didn t enter a comment Very smooth operation speedy I ve not used this version of Windows so taking my time to test drive newer applications BUT very pleased Would recommend I got this laptop from the treasure truck I have been wanting a new laptop so it was perfect timing This laptop was really easy to get set up I haven t had a bigger laptop in a long time but as a college student it s much better to have large screen and keyboard to do work It s not a touch screen which I really like I might use it for video games at some point but that s not my main priority with this laptop It is ideal for my step daughter s on line tutoring She absolutely loves it Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it s too early to rate but so far I m very pleased It s very slim and lightweight The set up was super easy It boots up almost instantly The key board is easy to maneuver The built in mouse pad works extremely well The screen quality is very good the monitor is bright I only use it for basic things like email social media research on line shopping etc so it fits my needs perfectly The battery life is decent It came loaded with Windows which is great but unfortunately Windows is not compatible with my printer The trade off is that Windows is far superior to Windows in all other respects The test will be to see how long it all holds up I m optimistic though The brand makes very good products it works excellent but for the amount that I end up paying I would have preferred to buy a inch one since I was charged twice for the import One is charged by AMAZON at the time of purchase and you also pay the import to the FEDEX Mexico parcel service at the time of delivery I m still learning how to use the features As far as I know it does not have a touch screen It has issues connecting to the internet wi fi after updating It does not have a place to connect an ethernet cable which I should have checked before buying It allows me to do what I need to do so far I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account The computer works perfectly Media Tek MT WiFi ax adapter does not consistently start from the sleep mode Every to days it goes dead Same condition happens with both and GHz It can be recovered by completely powering off and turning it back on This might have to be done a couple of times The driver version is and is the current driver per HP s web page The laptop works OK with a Cat internet connection A UNI USB C to Ethernet adapter cable is required as well as a Cat cable direct to a router port An extra expense to keep it running This is a workaround till I can find time to work with HP I would like to install a new wi fi adapter Very nice laptop at this price point No back light of course also no User Manual as far as I can tell Would buy it again This laptop is more for social Media app games etc It s good but very little memory and the screen resolution is poor I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one The screen is huge The processing apeed is okay too It s just that i m not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard The letters shift to the left because of the additional numbers on the right side Other than that it is very good quality laptop and I m satisfied qith it Sometimes when I write on social media E mails ect if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it Could be my fault Otherwise I like it My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money It arrived in very good condition Starts very fast good price I got this computer because I wanted an affordable pc after years of macs and hating their keyboard A couple things I have notice about this computer Keyboard and pad are nice good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark And to right click on the track pad still confuses me Screen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting Computer is a little flimsy when folding unfolding Windows I am actually pretty happy with Takes a little getting used to but I like the os Overall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for Fast computer for college Clear screen My Kindle books are crystal clear We purchased this for my dad for Christmas It is his first ever laptop It s great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on He absolutely loves it I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books it s not built for gaming at all I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews But I m glad that I did because my pc arrived early and in good quality I m in love And yes it s for gaming also because I played on it and it performed well If you re thinking about getting this DO IT Don t listen to these people most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it For what I need this is perfect I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great Watching a video the resolution is hd The camera quality is hd Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use Since it does not have a built in CD DVD player it is very light weight I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive Glad I bought this I love my new laptop It is fast and works really good So far I have not had any problems with the Laptop Only weeks into using it and all is good so far I ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences I think this will also be a good purchase This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in I was not unhappy with my year old machine but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation and the battery needed replacement The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice I found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software I am still in the transfer process This is disappointing I use this laptop for work especially spreadsheets and data every and I m very pleased with the quality Very easy to set up Its okay so far I ve had it for less than a month and the battery does pretty fast I don t even use it often No touchscreen Very nice it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user After some struggle now the laptop is usable support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support i bought it when from Treasure Truck i got very good discount i already use it for a while everything work very well so far love this laptop I have an HP at work like everything about it When it was time to replace my old computer I chose an HP for home use Very happy with it so far I m not a gamer I use it for e mail internet and tax preparation Great laptop plenty fast for home recording with no latency I ve had it for about months now with absolutely no issues The review says to rate the touch screen but there is not a touch screen I purchased adapters one for the Ethernet connection and one for the mouse Would have liked another USB port The keyboard has a good feel but the shiny silver with the thin letters is annoying for me Installation was fine once I got past all the questions that were asked Speed is very good Have installed several HP computers in the past Don t place this at the top I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you it could take jamming Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional I have absolutely no issues with this laptop In fact i will be buying one for my son for his birthday Definitely recommend I thought I was purchasing a new gaming laptop I m pretty sure it was refurbished and it is definitely NOT for gaming It has many glitches sometimes drops internet and now the camera refuses to work even though it is downloaded It is now more like a beautiful paperweight than a working computer crappy tin keypad locks up alot It s of those laptops that you took the battery out to restart only now you push every key with your palm to get it responding has to be much better one for half the money out their If I could have figured out how to clear what we already put on the laptop I would have returned it Excellent value for the price Had everything I needed tbh A big thanks to Techno Panda on YouTube for the review and recommendation I added another GB RAM as soon as I got this new PC and it works really well Restarts quickly Chrome browser opens quickly Can handle demanding tasks like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro CC with little or no delay I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back I can t believe how crappy the screen quality is My year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing The last laptop I bought was in is it a requirement now that you need to spend for anything decent This was a gift for my son and he loved it very much It s good for both homework and games Bought it as a surprise for my grandaughter and she loves it She has always liked mine and has wanted one like it One of the best laptops I have ever owned I like HP products and this computer is not an exception My earlier older slower and heavier laptop died between Zoom meetings So it was research time and get an order placed was I ever surprised when two days later I had a new laptop and was set up and handling everything like before Working great with Chrome where many of my files were stored The computer was good looking and pretty responsive The screen had a sharp image But that s as far as I got I had the computer running a total of about hours when it put up a blue screen and froze Will I get another HP I d like to think this is one in a million but I do get dubious This laptop is probably just fine for someone else but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop and can also be used in place of a password for many websites My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference It was a mistake to order this laptop This laptop has everything I need without paying a high price Nice to look at super thin and light weight and was easy to set up and it came with Windows I love my new HP laptop The quality this laptop is all it was advertised to do I am so very pleased For the price its a great laptop does everything i need it to do great buy my kids love them Gear fit and finish Very well known brand that holds up to its name well Unfortunately we got this as a gift for someone overseas so unable to return it or I would have As others have mentioned this keyboard has gray letters on silver keys Almost no contrast unless you have perfect lighting so in real life it often won t be anywhere as good as they picture they posted Unfortunately the first times I used it before sending it off was daytime with excellent lighting so I managed to get by But in less than perfect lighting it s a real strain to see the keys I searched in vain to see if they had backlight which is the only thing that could have saved things Also minimal tactile feedback Unless you plan to always use an external keyboard stay away from this laptop Such a shame they never got user feedback on this keyboard design So much faster than any laptop I have had I had to get one with lots of RAM and SSD This would have been a bargain at twice the price I loved it it s not heavy it s fast it has installed everything I need anti virus I recommend it Excellent very good quality Well worth the money Good basic laptop for my middle school aged daughter Everything works and she is happy with it So far no issues and it functions as it should Bought this for my daughter for online school and she loves it Wish it had a backlight for the keyboard but otherwise I have no issue with it Great speed and easy to navigate Only had this laptop for a short while but so far so good Easy to navigate clear screen No issues to date Slowest computer I have ever had Only purchased to use adobe and editing software as I have a chromebook that does everything else but does not support adobe software I have had HP in the past and hoped for a better experience since the last time I purchased an HP was in for college however All other features are fine Just very slow loading Got this for my college Freshman daughter she absolutely loves it So light to carry around campus fast connections and the battery lasts all class day Not to mention all the non class things she does Facebook reading streaming ETC I was concerned about not having a backlit keyboard and no touchscreen however the keyboard is really fine and easy to see The touchscreen is really not missed This is value for you money Great Display and quality screen If I needed another one would definitely purchase again Who ever thought of silver keys with light gray numbers and letters should lose their job Barely visible even if your are directly looking at them Almost makes me feel like returning it just for that reason Other than that it s a decent computer Liking it so far Quiet and fast Decent battery life Light weight is nice Miss my Dell touch screen and backlit keyboard Otherwise decent quality The shift key for sign for email comes out as The shift comes out as Update Apparently I set the language as English UK instead of English USA Working fine now Great for gaming Use it all the time for the sims worth it The laptop is great for the price point Just think of the laptops before touch screen and in Very pleased with this purchase Great laptop for the price wish it had a larger SSD drive I talked two of my friends into buying this laptop also This computer has had issues with connecting to WiFi connection Super slow connection and keeps going out when other device have no issues The backlight is super dim even at the brightest setting I also struggled to get this computer connected to two monitors May have been the adaptor but the adaptor worked with two other computers Overall I got this one for the extra ram and faster processor but it feels slower than my old one Not sure what the overall problem is This laptop works like a charm No complaints Responds quickly has good battery life Really amazing laptop only thing i wish had a better battery and backlit keyboard but that is my own personal preference The laptop itself I recommend Just the right memory etc for my home office needs Very thin build quality is nice great performance I upgraded my RAM from gb to gb I want to start by saying that I love the big screen and Microsoft office runs well on the computer but for the life of me I cannot figure out why it is so fickle when it comes to wifi connectivity Sometimes it connects to wifi with no problems but other times it won t even register that there is wifi available let alone connect to it It is incredibly frustrating and you probably need a computer that connects to the internet so I would not recommend this computer Works great I needed thiz Enjoy the functions but no CD ROM Average price more computer than needed for the person I gifted it to The screen very well everything worked just great was delivered to my us imaginary address then forwarded by our logistics company outside the us arrived safe and sound works so far so good knock knock The computer arrived securely packaged It looks and performs just as advertised Although it doesn t have a touchscreen it performs well otherwise Product was in excellent condition Nice screen quality great for gaming Great job The computer looks and feels sleek It s a powerful unit But it doesn t matter at all when windows has a fault that will endlessly disconnect the wireless network adapter inside the laptop itself If you can afford something newer or ever run windows for the time being I recommend that highly I m so pissed at this laptop I ve probably reset the network settings and restarted it times in months Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she s enjoying it immensely Had no issues Product was fine and shipping was quick I thought I had bought the right la too But the battery dies really fast Don t recommend it I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck But like many of the other reviews stated there is constantly issues with the WiFi Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep the next time I boot it up WiFi cannot be located Long story short I returned the damn thing This new computer was a Christmas gift for our daughter and it is perfect for her daily use Like it was easy to fire it up I like it lighter then the old one I ordered it with shipping to Honduras through a mailbox in Miami and it arrived in perfect condition I loved it It s super fast It s fast it s easy to use and it was just as advertised Needed a new one My husband really likes this laptop With the clear screen And easy to use process He uses it everyday This was a Christmas present for my wire she was very happy with it Love it so far and very fast Fast shipping too Laptop did a system update that deleted the wifi drive Tried many options but cannot restore wifi Tried to restore to factory settings but now windows won t even open Did a google search an learned this is a popular problem many had with their laptops as well UPDATE Amazon support transferred me to HP since it is still under yr manufacture warranty After long calls and multiple attempts HP support was able to restore to factory settings I missed days of work lost records had to get my computer setup for work all over again I was told I could seek compensation I would have to send in a company letter head stating the amount of pay I lost After a week of calls from their supervisors who kept escalating the issue I got the end user He claimed there is no such thing as compensation and that all the previous supervisors lied to me I was offered a coupon for a future HP product I m going back to MAC It s a great laptop for the price Very good FAST DELIVERY PACKAGED WELL PLENTY FAST COMPUTER SPEED WITH GB RAM AND SSHD So far so good A nice product online banking bill paying shopping love the speed Nice laptop excellent delivery time Replacement laptop for my last HP Lightweight and good battery life This is the traditional computer I needed I got it at good price on Cyber Monday Good performance small but nice Easy setup good battery life and nice screen Easy to use mainly used for research gmail MF Could not see very clear as I have low vision Thank you The laptop is a standard laptop no extras which is what I needed Two weeks into owning the laptop the WiFi completely disappeared off it and all the computer was detecting was a LAN I factory reset the computer and all was fine for two more weeks when I woke up and did it again Had to send back the computer for a full refund luckily I was still in the window for returning it Super light and very fast finally a beautiful computer Very nice computer ideal for personal use and business Not too happy with the device Overall performs weaker than my last computer at the same price point also HP with less features touch screen can turn into a tablet by folding I would personally return this if I didnt get it online and had to deal with shipping back and forth Great laptop for the money Excellent quality good performance The laptop was perfect at first exactly what I needed but it s been months and I ve already taken it to support twice The first time was about a month ago because it stopped connecting to wifi it didn t even show the networks Then I woke up today with an alert that said that the fan and the battery weren t working properly and the keyboard was all messed up the letters are pressed forever How do a fan and a battery break after months of normal use I bought it and came back to Argentina where I live and there s no HP support here so I just have to keep taking it and paying more money to get it fixed Buy something else So far so good the windows is a none friendly system that a middle tech average person can not use to it s full advantage and should not be advert in that manor For starters this was a warehouse deals Always know that they re hit or miss This laptop seemed great at first Booted up Went through the setup process So good Did the updates No issues Then I noticed internet speeds slow Weird Forced ghz Speeds up Then wifi died Weird Turn off laptop Power button to turn on no response Tried again next day nothing rd day powers on but wifi still not working so I say ok time to send this back after I do a factory reset Factory reset not working glitch in windows Downloaded a USB win imagine to do a fresh install but it wouldn t find the storage Had to load the driver manually what a pain I purchased this laptop from Treasure Truck It was at a wonderful price Typically when I choose to purchase electronics from Amazon I am offered an extended warranty I was not offered a warranty for this machine so I looked up the item at the regular price and the extended warranty option was listed I called Amazon to setup and purchase the guarantee but was told to contact the manufacturer I contacted HP several times could not connect to a human so I entered the serial number as instructed but the HP system indicated it had no record of the machine s serial number This transaction seemed suspicious to me so I returned the item Not good The keys were loose and the plastic holding the keys in place was warped and very flimsy The overall feel of the computer is very cheap for the price tag I couldn t say much about the battery or specs because to be honest I opened it up and noticed straight out the box it was such low quality I Just sent it back for a refund I had the exact same wi fi network issues as everyone else has mentioned I bought this for graduate school and online classes I need a more dependable wifi computer than this one The Troubleshooting recommended attaching an ethernet chord but there is no ethernet port to connect to on the laptop I tried resetting my modem and restarting the computer multiple times to no avail The laptop isn t recognizing ANY network phone hotpsot or internet modem I tried registering it on HP and the product number cannot be found so I was SOL on HP tech support too I m processing a return today loved all when I turned it on and signed in I could not make a desktop icon Not a big deal but there was no information on the internet on how to fix it besides making a custom shortcut But in doing so you don t get the icon so instead of making a custom icon for something i bought brand new I contacted support it took me almost an hour to actually talk to a person it took the person minutes to before they actually gave me half a response related to my issue They stated that it was a software issue and I needed to contact their SmartFriend support You need to pay for that service So the brand new laptop i had just opened without installing anything on it had a software problem they wouldn t try and resolve without me paying for help This is a great brand and business I bought this to replace my current i Dell which is years old It has slowed down considerably and it constantly loses its wifi connection At first about a year ago it would happen once or twice a week but now it happens every few minutes NOT my wifi All other devices work fine I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago and it only made it worse I need reliable WIFI for my job to attend Zoom and Teams meetings Out of the box I was impressed with this model s speed and connectivity But I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home it would not connect again It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished It s only a week old I m returning this and going back to Dell I got this as one of the Treasure Truck deals and was excited to use it I ve had it for days and didn t even use it every day I opened it tonight and there was no internet connection Upon investigation there was no wifi device detected I m so upset I opened reviews here and saw a long review that covered this same problem in detail I immediately initiated the return and requested a refund It worked fine until I did the Windows update and then the wifi disappeared like it never existed WIFI adapter stopped working just over months of having this laptop HP said since this is software issue and software warranty is just months and hardware warranty is year I can pay for them to help me fix this issue for the first month When I have taken it in to my university to have them fix it they told me for some reason the laptop will not accept the new software from either HP or Intel website Going to have to factory reset my laptop weeks into a new laptop Lap top is no longer accepting WiFi says something about hook up to Ethernet cable doesn t make sense This laptop worked for just under a month and then the wireless card gave out All of my devices including my year old HP Envy laptop are connecting just fine to my network I ve restarted run diagnostics and still nothing It continues to say there are no networks available which means that the wireless card isn t working at all It s not even finding other local networks let alone mine Since this thing doesn t have an Ethernet cable port it s useless now since I can t connect to the internet with it Returned Thought this to be an ok mid priced unit Liked it at first Then it kept dropping off line The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting This happened about every minutes Two other computers in my house do not do that Internet is fine Sent it back as defective They deducted as a restocking fee FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE Do not buy this unit Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly Just about weeks after its April th delivery this computer booted up to a different interface and we could not get the system back to its normal function despite the many options shown on the screen including selecting the option to do a fresh install of windows system restore etc I am now left with a fancy shell of an inoperable device I thought we were getting a nice basic laptop for my senior mother It was nice for a few weeks then started having issues and eventually the option for wifi completely disappeared After hours troubleshooting with windows and it s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period I don t recommend this device It is flimsy which is a little expected considering price Also not a touch screen Overall I would not recommend this laptop I only used it a couple of days when I got up one morning and it wouldn t pick up any wifi networks I tried to find out why but there was nothing showing as to why it wouldn t find any networks So I had to once again break out my old outdated laptop While I was able to use it it was working OK The only issue I had with it was I was unable to unlock and move the taskbar When left clicking the taskbar only taskbar settings would show up with no option to unlock it I am waiting to see if Amazon HP will honor the warranty My laptop developed vertical lines less than months after i bought it Based on a test it was determinized that it was a hardware issue The laptop was not subject to abuse I am a year old granny that keeps my laptop in my home I do not carry my laptop around I will let you know if Amazon HP make it good Thanks Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it It had a second life used refurbished sticker affixed to it I looked up the serial number on HP s website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it months ago If you re interested in this laptop I d suggest you look for it elsewhere I can t trust Amazon to send a new unit Do not buy Within a month of purchasing the wireless adapter just suddenly stopped working and disappeared Upon further reading of the reviews of this computer apparently this is a common problem So save yourself the frustration and avoid buying this I m giving Amazon high marks for giving me the option to return it for a full refund without hassle I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out Set it up and then one day later it wouldn t identify the WiFi I tried network reset reset adapter but nothing worked Had to send it back Don t buy this one There is some problem with the WiFi adapter This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working I ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it I m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window Barely two weeks after having received the laptop the wifi drivers are barely working The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections Yesterday no amount of restarts worked and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery Sending mines back Wifi function routinely disappears The fix is spending hours on the phone with hp while they completely wipe the laptop and reinstall everything Really handy AND since there s no ethernet port it s basically the most worthless laptop available Purchased brand new Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in There s also a fun bug in Windows that turns off the wifi by itself and won t let you turn it back unless you do a full power down I ve run all Windows updates Restarting the computer doesn t fix the issue Pretty bummed out that I ve only had this a few months and it s a complete lemon Not sure I ve had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before I ve had this laptop for less than hours and there is no Wi Fi capacity only VPN or Ethernet In that is totally unacceptable Don t waste your time or your money I spent over an hour on the phone with HP only to have the representative hang up on me when she wasn t able to identify the issue Thankfully Amazon will refund my money but in the meantime I will have to go buy a working PC that actually has Wi Fi capability Worked fine for few months and then started loosing internet connection requiring to connect repeatedly but now it won t connect to internet at all Tried to get support on chat but wasn t helpful tried resetting etc including factory reset and nothing works I enjoy the product a lot until it crash Touch screen Nope Touchpad If you are holding the laptop every part of it acts like a touchpad but only when it s not supposed to Aggravating to say the least Perhaps it s a new feature designed to prevent people from spending too much time on social media The product page for the HP dy nr is unremarkable in that it does not really let you know what product line this HP laptop is part of It s also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are without getting one For the curious the loadout is as follows Intel Core i U this is a th gen Alder Lake part with P cores with HT and E cores threads WDC PC SN GB this is a PCIe x NVMe SSD GB of DDR ick The machine is pretty fast but the GB of RAM is a strange choice considering it s a T CPU The screen is x and it appears to be an IPS panel The screen is clear but peak brightness is only average The Xe IGP graphics are better than older Intel IGPs but it s still not up to the level of what you d get with an RDNA APU much less a gGPU If you re a gamer you ll want to look elsewhere The large footprint makes a large keyboard possible The spacing is good and the chicklet keys aren t bad but you will get a get a decent amount of clatter and flex while typing It s not a premium experience but I still found it easier to type on this keyboard than on most laptops The SSD while a x unit is about half the speed of nice PCIe x units I really didn t find it to be a bottleneck for normal business workloads but it wasn t great when I would install massive NPM packages The wifi capability is provided by a MediaTek MT ax The card and onboard antennas work fine Battery capacity is not stellar and I would not expect to get more than or hours out of a charge The power supply is physically tiny with a W capacity Unfortunately there s no USB PD charging here External connectivity consists of two USB A ports a full size HDMI port a USB C port a combo headphone mic jack an full size SD card reader No Thunderbolt here The front facing webcam is better than some but still not good The speakers are top firing and are better than many in this laptop price class By that I mean that they get sufficiently loud No they re not great but they re fine perfectly adequate for YouTube podcasts and even the occasional Netflix movie At this HP laptop is in a weird spot It s definitely in a different performance tier than the laptops It actually feels like a modded car the CPU outclasses the rest of the machine with the GB of RAM feeling like the biggest constraint In reality though the GB is just fine for several browser tabs Office I ve run several instances of VS Code at once with Node Express running in each If you don t care about a machined aluminum case an all day battery or a dGPU and you JUST want good performance at the price point this is a great laptop Conditionally Recommended Reasonable computer for a good deal Quality was weak flexible in areas it shouldn t be Mine had sound issues where if the laptop was tipped sound would go out and sound bad Also if you pushed in the middle of the keyboard or by the speakers it would go out as well Returned for refund As soon as I plugged in this new laptop it popped up with the name Andres Garcia and asked for a PIN There were also a bunch of old saved wifi addresses This was definitely not a new or even a professionally refurbished laptop This was almost certainly stolen and resold DO NOT BUY Died just outside the amazon protection window just under months after purchasing HP has non existent customer service so good luck getting your year manufacturer warranty The HP Laptop dy nr is capable of web surfing and checking email and maybe a little Microsoft word It is full of the usual HP bloat ware most of which can be uninstalled This is not a gaming laptop I installed the online game Runescape and it was able run ok but No Man s Sky ran for a few seconds and shut down probably due to a memory problem With only GB of ram and a GB SSD it is very limited It is small light and mostly plastic There are no user serviceable panels to remove to upgrade ram etc There is no user manual that I am aware of that explains how to do anything to this laptop I believe you can remove the entire back to gain access to the ram and SSD I may do this at a later date and will post pictures if I do According to online memory sellers the ram is upgradable to a max of GB with DDR PC MHz SODIMM NON ECC Unbuffered pin V CL sticks for a cost of around To upgrade to GB it will cost over The SSD can be upgraded to GB or TB This laptop does not have a CD DVD Display Port or a USB port for charging the laptop It does have a full size HDMI Port a USB C data port and USB A data ports It also has a head phone microphone port and a full size SD card reader and of course a port for the charging cable All ports tested and worked as expected The keyboard is chicklet style but works well and the touch pad works well also The speakers are loud enough I connected a wireless mouse with no problem I used the USB C port to connect to my Galaxy S G cell phone and all worked as expected It has a camera for Skype or other video call software The screen is bright and looks good to me The Wi Fi works great This laptop works well for Web Surfing and email but if you want to do more you will need to upgrade Update I installed Crucial RAM GB Kit x GB DDR MHz CL or MHz or MHz Laptop Memory CT K G SFRA A for and a Team Group MP M TB PCIe x with NVMe D NAND Internal Solid State Drive SSD for and everything works great No Man s Sky game plays great now As promised I posted pictures in the video I hope this helps Of course if you attempt these upgrades it will most probably void your warranty This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use The build quality is great with no issues The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions The Intel Core i U packs enough processing power for it s intended usage but only having GB of ram does bring some concern when considering long term usage Windows runs snappy and smooth with this configuration but the drawback is you cannot upgrade the memory This laptop as configured is more than enough power for daily task at home or at work I did drop a star because of the inability to upgrade the memory With that out of the way this is a solid laptop Games can be played on this laptop but be mindful of the specs This is not intended to be a gaming laptop Yes it can play games but it will not compete with a dedicated gaming laptop During long usage the bottom does heat up It s as expected with this CPU it s not a deal breaker The battery life is good I did install Ubuntu in dual boot mode Linux runs great and everything was detected I use Linux a lot daily along with Windows Internet worked day until th day internet didn t work at all took to Best Buy said internet broken defect computer totally junk beware junkyard computer I bought two of these Mine suddenly lost Wi Fi connectivity even a complete reset didn t fix the issue My wife s glitched from day one and did not run smooth During setup the computer froze up wasn t able to connect too wifi wasn t able to fix the problem with HP tech support This is decent laptop light weight and thin computer Keys are large and keyboard overall is very comfortable and easy to read As every HP laptop it is good quality Processor th Generation Intel Core i U will boot this computer almost instantly I would say speed is outstanding So far I do not have any problems with this laptop With this processor GB DDR RAM and GB of SSD performances will be above expectations In my case battery will not last more than hours Using this computer for online meetings and most of the time creating presentations Battery charger is good will take about minutes to charge the battery I would recommend this computer Cheap made and flimsy This laptop is great for those on a budget and need something to do the basics with like browsing the web emails videos etc The laptop itself came packaged nicely to avoid any damage once i got it out set it to charge for a couple hours Setup was relatively easy took roughly about minutes with some updates Once setup was done did some browsing which was pretty smooth watched some youtube videos and didn t have any issues Processing wise it s not the best and would easily get bogged down if you are doing too much at once but for this price point it s a great laptop TL DR Decent entry level laptop with barely enough resources for basic computing Plenty of the standard HP bloatware preinstalled Only GB of ram and CANNOT upgrade There are MUCH better options out there at this price point REVIEW OF HP LAPTOP DY NR This laptop is a bit disappointing for the price at time of review I was excited for the new generation of intel processors So much power even in the lower end processors Unfortunately processing power only gets you so far when multitasking on Windows RAM is also a big deal if you want to multitask like having multiple internet browser windows and a few other applications open at the same time So to sum things up here are my lists of pros and cons for this laptop PROS Has WiFi which is currently the top standard for consumer WiFi th gen i processor has plenty of power for big chores CONS ONLY GB Windows itself takes up about gb without anything else running Start adding applications and you will max out VERY fast GB is simply not enough for basic computing in Cannot upgrade RAM Internals are not user serviceable So even if you wanted to upgrade you would be risking your warranty The back cover requires some surgery to remove Typical HP bloatware Most of it you can just uninstall but it is annoying that they still include all the advertising and bloatware out of the box Substandard screen Lots of light bleed on the edges Only p and not touchscreen Not able to be powered through USB C This should be a no brainer for companies nowadays Overall feel is cheap Touchpad keyboard casing all of it just feels cheap Overall I would not recommend this laptop unless you are only using it to browse the internet and check email If that is all you need it for then this might be a decent option However even then at this price point there are many other options out there to discover and research I will tell you right now that I did a search for similar specs but with GB of RAM and came up with several other options that were equal or LOWER price than this Bottom line if you do anything other than email and internet browsing this laptop is NOT for you The Good Light to carry easy to set up The Bad The GB RAM that you cannot upgrade limits how useful this is for me It s fine for some light web surfing and the occasional video but anything more than that drains the battery very fast I can t use it for any of my work because multi tasking on this just does the same not really designed to handle anything too taxing on the RAM The Bottom Line It s a middle of the road for me For entry level laptop It s ok for very light web surfing and basic functions but the limitations with the RAM make this hard to use for any heavy duty multi tasking that I would need for work Laptop quality is pretty good The IPS panel pairs well with windows I would recommend going for the gb version as with all laptops gb of memory is not enough for most takes in As I have pointed that out This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in The system will consume about gbs of memory just being turned on and with the bios locked down The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows The I processor is surprisingly good Averaging only a decrease in performance against the I model Not suitable for gaming IMO But I would recommend to most pc users Power users will know this is not what they are looking for For price it s a fabulous deal The C unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for It had instability frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem they convinced me not to return it I had to leave the country for several months The problem persisted At some point HP installed Win surreptitiously This stopped my microsoft programs from working I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win and do not work in win I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows to win at no charge I did not accept In June just before the warranty expired I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business the first was in and I gave them a second chance HP is both inept and dishonest Purchased as a Christmas gift on Nov th Box was never opened until Christmas morning Wife was thrilled Set up laptop to home WiFi and all seemed well until the morning of the th when wife went to log on and had no internet connection I tried to connect and soon realized the internet adapter in the laptop was dead I went through all the trouble shooting steps and the only thing it said was an ethernet cable was disconnected or broken The laptop has no ethernet ports Device manager only had Bluetooth and ExpressVPN TUN adapter listed The internal WiFi card is supposed to be a MediaTek Wi Fi MT x and Bluetooth combo Supporting Gigabit data rate internal chipset I reset the laptop retaining the personal user information and files and it still wouldn t connect I then just reset the laptop to factory default wiping all data so it booted up as it did Christmas morning After setting up location and keyboard it went to the screen in the photo above to connect to a network As you can see the next button is grayed out and you cannot proceed beyond this point There s a lot to like about this laptop excellent processor good amount of ram so so SSD storage but a lot to dislike about it also No up gradable storage or ram no backlit keyboard gray on silver lettering on the keyboard no removable swap able battery it s internal I have used HP products for years and had my fair shape of issues with them but they have generally proven reliable This is the poorest implementation of a laptop I ve ever seen It s going back to Amazon for a full refund I have seen others with the same issues on HP s support site and it s a relatively new laptop What a waste of money time and effort HP if your going to integrate everything in a throwaway design at least make it reliable for few years I DO NOT recommend purchasing this for anyone I was lucky if you can call it that mine failed within a week of ownership Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over This is my rd HP laptop and my first windows pc I bought it to replace a year old Windows HP Stream that I have kept up to date I will be using this mostly for web browsing and streaming video and can truly say I m amazed by just how much faster this is Video and sound quality is excellent and web pages load instantly I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new laptop for personal use I bought this laptop for my husband for his th birthday His laptop was years old and was on it s last leg He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past years but this one is perfect The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers He plays word games and does puzzles explores websites he emails spends time on Facebook checks out his sports neighborhood stuff etc and if he wants to explore more he can It s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease It s perfect and the price was SO right Oh I also purchased the insurance plan just in case That too is a great deal and great idea in my opinion Stars I am more than pleased with how easy it was transferring my files photos etc from my old laptop to this one Being a senior I am limited at times dealing with technology and since I keep all my records in a vault recovery of those files was critical for retaining my medical financial photo s etc it was important not to lose them My old laptop had zero memory available but I was able to link the use of both laptops and transfer my files with little effort at all Very happy with this purchase Ignore the bad reviews this is a very good laptop I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a new laptop Update It got stuck more times and won t connect to the wifi unless it is shut down will be returning unfortunately I bought this computer to replace a Toshiba laptop I ve had for years and is now dying on me I do like this computer and I ve only had one issue so far It got hung up and I had to shut it down and restart it to be able to reconnect to the wi fi Other than that it has been great It s fast and lightweight I use it primarily for note taking journaling and household tracking such as finances through word and excel and for those reasons I love it The camera is better than my old laptop but nothing stellar I have not tried to stream video or used sound yet so I can t comment on that Overall happy with my purchase so far as long as it doesn t have the issue with the wi fi again Wife uses this for work and has done well so far waited a little bit before review to see how it would be and has been great Battery has been solid screen great and easy to use easy set up light weight and durable to an extent feels a little flimsy but it s a slim laptop shipping was fast great product so far Bought this over a year ago and love it Just bought a second one for my father and he s happy too Great price great machine and it s lightning fast I use it mostly for work so Microsoft a office products Some tv streaming My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition I mostly use it for work but have used it for some older games and it works well I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers After days trading with amazon com it s symbol showed up on the st app web page I realized that this is built with an advanced AI system Amazon has been collecting data concerning my buying habit for many years and it suggesting this and that beforehand But it will never be like human because human mind is many hued animal All around its a good laptop Its fast and reliable However there is nearly zero gaming potential This thing only has go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem With all that said everything else is great Very fast and efficient responds well when scrolling down and back to top so far it is an excellent Laptop Does what I need and for a great price from the Treasure Truck Very good screen quality Easy set up SSD is great I am more than pleased with my new laptop It was more than I expected in a laptop Is fast and it was a great value for the money This is a great laptop I love it Start up was fast Everything is fast on this laptop Buy this one You won t regret it Great laptop for price Very nice laptop It does what I need and was easy to get started with It s very good the laptop works well and it kept well the only problem was the time taken to arrive more than a month the problem not from the seller but the company that you send the order in my country thanks amazon I love the size It has everything I wanted except a touch screen which isn t important now that my granddaughter is older The speed is great and it has a key which I hadn t noticed until I received it Great price for all the features Got this for my year old son for school It works great fast picture is SUPER clear speakers were awesome It was an excellent price for everything that comes in this laptop Perfect for my needs Got as a deal great value Would definitely buy again Works perfectly love it Beautiful hp Laptop quick delivery GREAT price The laptop is as good as it is nice and shine brand new config is fair relative to its price wow if I d been a little more patient and wait till the BF sales with the same price I could get a more advance model of the same series with fingerprint reader and double SSD space well not bad anyways i bought this because i work from home it was very easy to set up it runs well good cpu speed for multitasking nice keys nice screen and surprisingly good speakers the biggest problem i have is the battery life it s advertised as an average hours but i started working hours ago with battery life and with battery saver on and performance settings chosen by windows i m sitting at wtf but if i choose best performance but then the text will be difficult to read and everything will just look horrible also there s not light indicator for the num lock button as there is for mute caps lock and power so when you pressing numbers on the right if you inadvertently press num lock you re not typing anything that can get annoying No touch screen no sd card reader no back lit keyboard no cd Replacement for my other HP that crashed This seems smaller though dame size screen I should have paid more attention when ordering and should have more due diligence Keeping it but lesson learned I bought a sd card reader and usb light for keyboard works great really needed this This seems to be a good computer fairly reasonably priced very light and thin Fast I m not sure yet about the battery I ve had one incident in which the notice came on that the battery was low Usually I use it so close to where I plug it in that I use that and am not sure abut the battery This is the second one the first had a problem and had to be returned There was some confusion with HP and Amazon but Amazon came through for us However the return wasn t as smooth as most Amazon returns possibly because it was a computer It had to be taken toa store that was further away and that I don t shop at The silver keyboard is attractive but makes it hard to see This could be fixed by making the letters thicker therefore darker It is all in all a good machine Thus replaced my desk top For I took for my office really good laptop For the price this is a great laptop It s fast and responsive I would definitely recommend this to anyone I need hot spot but it works really well I love the computer This works wonderfully for what I need it for It responds very fast and the pictures are sharp and clear The solid state memory has been a pleasant surprise as it s the first of its kind I have owned The wide screen allows me to work with multiple windows making drag and drop easy The only thing that annoys me is that you need to use the Fn key to access F keys I like the laptop but the description is wrong on the site no back lit keyboard no finger touch log on it s working fine but false advertising as it s best it s like the reviews are for all the laptops like this model because it says on thing in the description only to not have it when it shows up Laptop operates at a good speed and is reliable Everything is fine accept for the fact that it doesn t have a backlit keyboard as advertised I will be contacting Amazon Love it It was represented as a gaming laptop It s far from that but it is what it is The speed of the laptop is very good I have it with Windows it runs programs like photoshop and illustrator very well in the gaming part I would give it an out of gears does not run very well I have made several configurations but it closes other games like Dragon Ball FighterZ run very well On the hardware side it would have been more convenient to have the power button at one of the two ends and not near the delete button in general it is a very good computer for work issues it is very good I have not yet investigated whether it works with windows hello at the moment it only lets me log in with a PIN it does not have a fingerprint option I bought this product to replace my old Dell Studio Laptop so I can work from home and perform multiple tasks simultaneously I was a Dell fan for many years and at first was hesitant to buy this HP Laptop but ultimately decided to go for ir since it offered me a brand new machine with the screen size that I was used to the latest software and processor generation available and more importantly a solid state drive At this price I could only get older used or refurbished laptops of this and other brands so it was a no brainer I waited for about a year to purchase a new laptop and I m glad I waited and found this one for under I ve been using this laptop for over months now and I have no complaints whatsoever Everything looks and works great fast startup and shutdown and it doesn t get hot after many hours of continuous use I bought a USB splitter and a lamp that I can place right over the keyboard and the lack of multiple USB ports and a back lit keyboard was solved The screen is great But it arrived with nothing to plug it in for charging I had to find one from an old computer There is no touch screen or back up light It s a good tool Very good Like screen size and speed Great value Value for the money Light weight Easy to use windows is set up a lot different than Love this computer Ease of use and extremely fast Very nice laptop Will do everything I need it to do Seems to work well with what I use it for but would have liked a built in disc drive and SD card slots I ve had this laptop for about almost months Everything was going great until two nights ago when the laptop began to glitch The cursor is blinking overtime I have an extension mouse as well and I have to use that one in order to get to what I am trying to open The amount of money for this item and it s clutching I bought this for my business I figured I wouldn t have to purchase a new one for a while However this is not good very good computer I have had a inch HP for about a decade and was shamed into updating since it was running Windows That and I had loaded it down to the point it as sloooww Bought this newer version and very happy Not getting laughed at which is worth the price of admission This is not a touch screen I ve had it less than a week but so far all seems to be really good No complaints I am very happy with the laptop It has been a struggle with learning windows I have only had this laptop for a week The start up is quick I was pleasantly surprised how fast it is and how quick it handles a lot of things at once Would highly recommend This product is for home use It s easy to hook up and has great features Delivery was earlier than projected which was a plus A great computer and all I hoped for I love this laptop It works great and has been a great addition to my home office I bought this product for college and I paid the amount which is really expensive I finally got it and I was so happy to get my new computer but it didn t even come with windows I paid dollars for a useless computer then I need to pay more just to get windows No thank you I sent it back and am waiting for a refund Very fast processing speed Great graphics This is a nice little utility computer seems to have everything I need no touch screen but knew that ahead of time BUT HP decided to get REAL cheap in an underhanded way The forward facing camera while it appears to work just fine it is NOT an IR camera and therefore Windows can NOT log you in using the camera So for the next years every time I want to boot this laptop and use it I ll be typing in passwords and or PIN s Absolutely NO WHERE is this mentioned in all of HP s literature Seems a bit twisted to come pre installed with Windows but then due to a cheap made in china camera Windows Hello Face feature is completely unsupported Would NOT buy this product again Ever This is my rd HP laptop and I am shocked that they did this A usable cam would not have cost them more And then to not be up front about this and kind of hide this huge shortcoming is disappointing to say the least Would Not recommend if this is a feature you plan on using Makes me wonder where else in their selection of hardware that they got equally CHEAP with to save a few pennies This actually has no touch screen so cannot rate that part It is a good fast laptop and has good battery life Sold as having a backlit keyboard and it doesn t Overall operation is great But wish the keyboard lite up This is a misrepresentation of the product If I knew this would not have bought it Its twice as fast as my other computer It has HD lots of storage Nice size screen fast does everything I need This laptop is my personal computer It s so fast easy to read due to the large screen love the feel of the keyboard I love everything about it Was easy to set up with no problems One of the best Laptop computers I have ever bought Picture quality is great So far so good I purchased this laptop for a tech bootcamp and while I was excited to get it and am in love with the size the specs are different from what I got There isn t a backlit keyboard it doesn t have windows and the internet keeps dropping while I m in class etc I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me shipping info for a return I decided not to since I can update to Windows myself and then that s when the wifi started dropping randomly Amazon won t give me an option to talk to one of their reps and the seller is In my opinion find a better deal with less hassle Love it this is my first laptop Great price Exactly as described I like this computer easy to find and type numbers and letters Bought this for myself and it was fine for about six months then the fan went out Right after buying it for myself I bought one for my mom Hers came straight out of the box with a fan problem and had to be returned to Amazon for a replacement With two instances of buying this laptop I ve had two fan malfunctions way before I should have expected any issues Seems to be a common problem Fast and easy to use I liked it very good Nice laptop Convenient fast and nice experience with Windows But the battery life is poor With a battery charged the battery is exhausted in about hours For routine daily use you pretty much have to leave the laptop plugged into the charger I previously wrote the above review I must change it I consider this laptop to be a REAL LEMON STAY AWAY While recognizing that Windows is yet another Microsoft upgrade it must be loaded with undocumented features i e bugs Seems that anything you try to do invariably brings up an offer for product purchase or requires a password Willing to battle through for the sake of trying a new IOS the fun started to increase exponentially when I tried to install HP Smart to use my all in one HP ENVY printer There is absolutely NO ACCESSIBLE HP support Everything you try leads to an offer to Chat with the HP Smart Agent All you can do there is respond to questions it asks When none of the questions apply to your problem DEAD END Mostly Amazon shows facebook Nice sleek Long lasting battery A great replacement Bought this laptop so I would work abroad for weeks For few days before trip worked fine Morning I am leaving at airport it crashes I could not even get to log in screen Kept receiving error messages So I get to Greece and spend days running around to stores to fix it Returning this piece of junk as soon as I get back to the US It s wonderful I did not discover that I could not install programs such as Google chrome or other independent programs or my church or local companies that I order items from Is there any way I can oder another more expensive laptop I have only used thjis for primarily to read some issues of oour newspaper that are not printed on sATURDAYS The battery does not hold charge Fully charged battery lost after minutes from unplugging The bottom of laptop gets really hot I would not recommend Will return due to the incredible amount of heat that it puts out Excessive heat shortens the life of electronics For the cost I expected better Great laptop for the price My ssd gb boots up in seconds My year old Pavillion took minutes on a good day Slim and light weight The back lit keys are a pleasant surprise Battery life is slightly better than my old laptop but nothing to write home about Also no sd slot WHY only thing missing is a CD Drive EVERYTHING WORKS WELL Great Laptop you get what you pay for This laptop is great for getting clerical work or simple tasks such as web based business or office products completed I d say the only real drawback is the screen quality It looks rather washed out but otherwise it works great for what I need it to do Great for work good for watching videos and naturally bad for video games with the exception simple pixel or old indie games It also doesn t have a SD card reader built in but you can get a usb adaptar for that If you are going to process a lot of data at one time such as large databases or many browser windows I suggest upgrading the RAM to or GB as the GB it comes with gets eaten up quickly It is a simple and inexpensive upgrade and HP made accessing it easy Just watch out for the hidden screws under the rubber grips I was thrilled to find this computer for our homeschool family It is working great I love my hp lap top It is not a touch screen Took a little getting use To windows but I love it now Worth the money Use it a lot for home use Not business Nice laptop for school Easy to use Very fast Good storage Lightweight Love the big screen It s a great laptop for the price and space Perfect Great Easy to set up Dependable product I am using this to replace my old laptop at Home This one is so much faster to boot up and perform any activity I had my friend help me pick it out because he s good at this kind of stuff I ve had the computer now a few weeks and I m well pleased with it The only thing I wished is that the screen was brighter and they should make the power button stand out more than the rest of the keys It s a little hard to find Next time I think I would like to get one where the keys light up But overall I think it s a lot of computer for the money So far just a month with it But the large screen the processing speed i love Light up keyboard would have been a great idea though seeing that I use this mostly at nights when i m home However no complaints I am very satisfied with my purchase Respect from Jamaica This came with Windows S which seems fairly secure I have already upgraded to Windows S You can download apps only from the Microsoft store which is a disappointment The app store is very limited so you ll probably find that your favorite apps aren t there and cannot be loaded on your machine Apps like Google Earth Pro Google Earth banking and financial apps cannot be loaded You can remove the S but then you cannot put it back Okay so normally not a big believer in brand new basic laptops Like cars I would prefer to buy a higher spec laptop that is a few years old for the same amount of money However when this came up on Prime Day as a flash sale for Prime members I threw caution to the wind and recklessly spent my hard earned money on something that inflation had not yet seem to hit Unpacking Packaged like a refurb Generic cardboard box with plastic wrapped laptop in foam holders the AC adapter and two pieces of written documentation That s it No pretty outer box with all the specs fancy pictures of even color Though it looked like a refurb package unit was in fact brand new They didn t waste money on fancy packaging which let s be honest you don t need anyway First Impressions This thing is BIG A screen with bezels on all sides is hard to imagine until you are holding it Small svelte and built for the road warrior this thing is not Build quality Okay here is where the budget starts to shine through The entire case looks like beautiful brushed aluminum until you feel it There is no mistaking this it is the thinnest plastic that would hold the finish and provide a wet noodles worth of structural integrity There is greater than expected flex to the chassis the joints where the plastic panels meet feels like an old snap tite model and you just know that scratches and wear are going to be apparent in short order I am now searching for a case if they even make them for this as it appears to be a new model This is a laptop that will feel more at home being a desktop replacement than your sidekick on roadtrips Ports Access The box says seven ports which is par for the course but the composition of them again points to a budget price point Standard USB check HDMI check Card reader check USB C nope Separate headphone and microphone jacks nope And oh my when was the last time you saw a wired ethernet port with the expandable jaw that opens to allow that massive plug That is going back to pre wi fi days A USB C and separate jacks for mic and audio would have been welcome in lieu of that wired ethernet jack Again though this is a budget laptop and I will not fault the omissions at this price point On that note when I opened the laptop I was pleasantly surprised by what appeared to be a fingerprint reader above the ESC key Upon further examination the reader turned out to be the physical power button and the only thing it will do with your finger is cycle up and down to turn the pc on and off Also in today s age of USB C options it would have been nice to see the AC port use the USB C interface instead of the proprietary blue tip adapter that HP has been using for generations now I guess the good news is that if you have a blue tip or three laying around you have plenty of spare adapters Function Windows boots right up and for those uninitiated to it looks eerily similar to Apple s OS series The bottom task bar is now a dock and quick launch icons are centered in it now With GB of RAM an th gen i processor and onboard video being handled by Intel and sharing in that massive GB system RAM this is not your gaming laptop In fact you may or may not realize that for the cost of a good graphics card today you could easily buy two or three laptops like this for the price of a good GPU Stick with Hearts Solitaire and Minesweeper and you will be fine I do not game my work is office production and work related so I doubt I will tax the GPU and be very happy with what I find Overall the laptop feels quick as expected for ordinary tasks web surfing and production apps Sound Like TV s the speakers are there for the most basic sound you can tolerate If audio quality above the intense sound of an angry hornet in a tin can is what you crave grab your headphones or external speakers and rock on Keyboard As is common today chiclet keys with separate number pad to the right For all of the real estate this size laptop creates anything less than full size keys would be criminal and comical in appearance The keys have a nice feel to them They are not cherry switches but they do have tactile thumps when typing and don t feel like you are typing on top of foam rubber Something I have become very accustomed to and greatly miss is a lighted keyboard Unless I just cannot figure out how to turn it on which I doubt Suspiciously every function key has an alternate function like brightness up down volume up down track skip play and even airplane mode EXCEPT for f which has no alternate function whatsoever This is the typical location for keyboard light so it appears to be MIA Again for the price not going to complain and given that this is more a desktop replacement than a road warrior it should not impact most users anyway Noise You can always tell an older laptop by the amount of time the fans kick up in speed when using it For most newer laptops rarely do you hear the fans spool up as the hardware can handle most standard tasks The older the hardware gets the more it gets tasked by updated apps and requirements the more the fans spool up to accommodate the higher energy draw and load I have yet to hear anything but a whisper from this laptop Screen No it is not a touch screen Yes the panel exhibits a lot of variation when viewed from any angle other than directly looking at it I would say the direct zone is about degrees total from left to right before you get very noticeable color and brightness variations If more than one person is viewing or you let your kids use it in the car it is best used by at most two people sitting very close Wrap Up As with most anything in life it is a balance of cost vs benefit As I sit on this laptop and do this review it is clear to me what HP focused on and what they purposely left out to provide a laptop at this price point As a desktop replacement complete with physical ethernet jack this unit excels at a large display a decently tactile keyboard plenty of ports for common use and sufficient hardware to meet the expectations of the production surfing simple web based gaming crowd It will also please the occasional trip to the back porch for morning coffee while perusing your favorite blog But start to travel a lot with this putting it through the torture of soft sided cases airport screeners or even just riding shotgun to and from work on a regular basis it appears the chassis will quickly fall behind the performance of smaller display units or units made from actual brushed metal I have another HP with a touch screen metal case double the memory and double the capacity SSD in it If I factor price out of the equation this laptop is less than satisfying If I factor in the price and realize that the laptop I am comparing this one to is FOUR TIMES times more expensive I am quite happy with the serviceability and performance of this As with most things in life you get what you pay for and this is no exception The HP PC and laptops are the BEST there is and it LASTS for a REALLY long time I took mine from high school and used through my time at the university through my doctorate You guessed it THIS is my second one I could have fainted when I saw the price and bought this baby ASAP You actually would have to slam it into a wall to break it It s an excellent choice for school personal or business use The support is phenomenal When I think of HP what comes to mind is High Performance tech You can NEVER go wrong with HP s I Love This Laptop I have no problems with it at all The size is everything and the speed is an absolute PLUS I am satisfied with the laptop I got this laptop on Amazon days in October It was a great price and I needed to replace a year old laptop One BIG DRAWBACK The keyboard does NOT LIGHT UP I didn t think they made laptops with unlit keyboards That severely limits where you can use it I went through the complete ad and found no mention of the unlit board I like the product everything is in excellent working order beautiful screen and the price doesn t hurt your pocket Liked size and look did not like the keys are same as color of unit very hard to read needed to be darker Simple fast reliable and affordable Would recommend to anyone I am very pleased with this laptop BUY IT Everythings Fine Much faster than previous wis it had more USB ports Great laptop Screen quality is good Great product great seller would recommend Laptop is very quiet CPU speed is great Got this for my husband aka early Christmas gift He works hard and has had issues with his other used laptop He is most pleased It s a very nice laptop for the money He says there is no such thing as a perfect laptop so he wouldnt give it all five stars He didnt even know there was a touch screen The laptop itself is fine I bought it because I couldn t update my old laptop from Windows to Windows If I had known then what I know now I would ve taken my chances on keeping Windows Windows is such an intrusive cluttered jump through the hoops mess that I hardly use the new laptop Great price good investment So far I love the laptop It s bigger than I thought so I will definitely need a larger table for it It s easy to use and connect One of my favorite purchases I was looking for a simple computer and this is perfect for that However it is heavy it does the job it worth for the money this new laptop i got is excellent and very good value for the price Poor contrast with keyboard keys Poor design by HP I would say Lots of people do not have excellent vision White on black would have been much better as shown on my hand held calculator Getting accustomed to Windows is another story for a later time Great screen size and full keyboard but the disk kept failing despite updating drivers Also lost connectivity to the USB ports Returned after three weeks of use A great laptop well please I love this laptop because it is so fast and not too difficult for a lady who is and not very computer savvy I also have an HP printer I use this basically for personal stuff The first thing I noticed when it was delivered is that the laptop is HUGE I was disappointed because I thought it was a touch screen and I thought it would have lighted keys but it didn t have either It has a great looking screen display but the speakers are weak and the battery doesn t last long at all I wouldn t recommend this computer I purchased this HP especially for the size of the screen and this brand because my previous one was a HP and easy to use and the features a For a great buy Even has Solid State drive I rarely ever use my computer anymore I forgot to update to win so instead of buying it just buy new My old Lenovo was very slow I swear they program it to slow down after years Have been very happy with this computer Works great so far Will say at least for what I expect from a computer I love the size of the screen Makes it great for work Have had no issues opened and up and running in ten min Nice for the price One of the best electronic buys I ve made in a long time The size is great the style is great and the screen quality is so vivid I was so excited when this laptop arrived today it was delivered undamaged it was updated already with Windows it was so easy to set up Thank you It s incredibly fast and the inch screen is a joy Nice laptop works great I work in IT and I have no issues Its just really big thats my fault I love the number keypad I m going to need help with using the laptop The new generation is good at figuring it out I m old school and don t even know where to start I m going to need help I m and the new technology is not working out for me Buy the computer for the office Does the job works fine And it has a good screen Works fine Half of what it cost about years ago Great computer comes with MS word package Big screen Great sound speakers Very happy Wish it was a bit smaller but all in all I m much happier than the Chromebook I bought the year before Very fast long battery life The HD camera is great for streaming Huge screen Good quality Perfect condition and as described Excellent product Decent laptop to do basic stuff not a good option for gaming or graphics Good for email basic internet browsing and some streaming Easy to use Good size Happy so far with no complaints Great investment I mainly use this computer for working at home and some internet browsing It is much faster than the laptop with an i processor and twice the ram than it replaced For general tasks that aren t too demanding it is a good affordable option It is a nice laptop The quality is good But it is not cheap This is a really nice laptop Windows not as friendly to users as or This unit has intermittent ethernet port causing really strange problems WiFi works fine I have had the laptop for less than months and it does not work well at all It will routinely disconnect from Wifi even when I am in the same room as the router I try to link my airpods to it using Bluetooth and they won t stay connected even though these airpods can connect to my work computer and my phone very easily without any problems Every so often when I turn the computer on I get a message saying that a heating fan is not spinning and that I would have to try turning on the computer later I like saving money and I don t need anything beyond the basics in a laptop but I would like a computer that can turn on stay connected to the internet and allow Bluetooth pairing without causing me consistent problems Do not buy this product I get this laptop as a gift and it died after months The screen is completely black and can not turn back on It only works if I plug it into the tv with a hdmi which defeats the whole point of a laptop I updated the drivers but no change Wow No backlit keyboard and that is NOT disclosed on the product page Cant see the keys Bought a monitor light bar Far better Screen is not lit well and the vibrance is terrible Works fine but the casing is defective and already falling apart Now the laptop cannot be closed HP technical support offered to have it shipped back for repairs and said they would return it within to business days Who can be without their laptop for weeks My son can t because he s taking online colleges classes Beware of Amazon Lightning deals You get what you pay for Product won t boot up less then months old and already have problems Amazon was of no help whatsoever very dissatisfied I did notike the fact that right in the middle of reading the news a porn sight popped up and my computer was locked down so I am returning it asap This is my second Chromebook My previous was cellular connect but sadly die on me and couldn t find another one But this is perfect for me not only is super fast the both time is on seconds only the performance is great I do everything on this light weight and easy to carry is excellent to take on the road And the battery life is good several hours before die No touch scream on this model but I don t feel the need to use that option The trackpad is very response and the screen definition full HD is great Overall I do recommend this product for catching up with your favorites website movies Netflix etc Almost forgot I got this one for the game play steam and I wasn t disappointed it handles well those games Sadly the steam service is going to be shut down next year but nevertheless it performs as advertised We just needed something simple as we did not have our businesses anymore This is very lightweight and easy to carry around and thin also It does not have a delete button though and that is the one thing we did not like We love it in general though Happy with purchase Laptop is in Great Condition looks brand new The only thing I wasn t aware of is that I would have to load Chrome Recovery Utility on to a USB using another Computer to get it to start up But besides that everything is good This is an excellent little Chromebook and I probably should know this but you might want to mention that it is not Windows compatible Needed a cheap but good laptop for work so I grabbed this hp chrome book and it s been very useful so far Fast start up good battery life It s very capable of doing everything I need so far this HP Flagship Chromebook Laptop Computer inch HD is Excellent perfect condition Esta laptop es excelente trabaja perfecto i like it so much i purchase This chromebook laptop is great for what it costs The price tag reflects the chromebook s natural lack of sophisticated abilities but this laptop is great for students on the go The battery life is conducive to a faster paced schedule and lasts well into the day without a charge Easily customizable this computer is well worth its price I ve only had it for month but the tablet was super easy to set up the keyboard is easy to use and super fast response The battery life is superb I use it for emails web surfing and its surprisingly good for watching movies TV and listening to music The Bluetooth is a big plus for me I use my earbuds and Bluetooth speaker So far so good I recommend virus protection It definitely is worth the MONEY It runs apps and can use Linux although that takes some setting up had to watch some videos to see what i could install overall a stable decent laptop for under bucks dont expect to play games on it though i use it mostly for web browsing and email Good for what I need it for but does have a habit of blacking out when in the middle of something Not sure why it does that I have had other Chromebooks that did the same thing Love it If I already put a comment on this before my opinion hasn t changed any I bought a refurbished one but the company said it was new whatever it was in excellent condition I had no complaints on that It works well in fact it has a better scree resolution than I thought it would and HP always seem to do well ln the audio department I might have wished for USB ports but so far I have no reason to use them Apparently this true of any HP Chromebook but they like to mount the battery underneath the keyboard and it wiii be a bear to replace I hope it has a very long life I got it at a good price the in house Linux was easy to set up that s one very important reason the GB disk space was important to me so I have no problem recommending this Chromebook Overall after I figured out how to get the touch pad activated I found it to be a really good PC It was very nice looking the screen was large and clear And was very light Weight I purchased this as I needed a light simple laptop to take with me when I travel I didnt need anything super fast or high dollar as I use my custom built desktop for that I ordered this knowing it was able to be returned I was surprised and very happy with what I got Package was well packed Simple Laptop and charging cable I charged it for a few hours and setup was a breeze Computer is nice light and works well The chrome OS is a little harder to setup and get where you want but its something you can GOOGLE If there is ANYTHING I can gripe about it is this The keyboard is in lower case and I doint like that Thats it Battery life is great and super light weight Sleek and cost effective I purchased this laptop for school work singing and podcasting I love it and give it a big ups This is a great laptop for the price however it s not touchscreen it s very light weight and easy for Travel purchased this chromebook in Sept of last year it came boxed with a notice inside saying they upgraded the resolution to a higher definition than originally suppose to have come with and boy did it show I m am a true believer in a chromebook it s fast easy to use and can do almost everything my hp windows laptop use to do the upgrades are fast and it notifies you when upgrade is available and all one needs to do is press the restart button and that s it I get my internet thru my lan line phone co which also provides a top notch anitvirus luv everything about this laptop My MacBook was giving me a hard time so I needed a new laptop fast for work that was cheap This exceeded my expectations Overall I love this computer If you re in need of a low budget laptop this is the product you want It s under and you can not beat it You don t have to download pay for Microsoft Word it comes with its own I love it I really do Thank You I decided to purchase this laptop after my desktop computer was annihilated from a windows update My desktop is currently up and running again although it s running slow so I figured having a backup of some sort where I can access important documents and whatnot is smart in case of emergencies i e work or school It s hard to believe this is a refurbished laptop because it runs so smoothly Definitely a worthy purchase so far really like this affordable refurbished guy i take it every where with me instead of my lb laptop take it in the hot tub and in the pool really great great key board great screen maybe one less point for the track pad but still good great internet fast and ready to go as soon as you open the puppy up problems week in knock on wood gooooood This does everything I need it to do and was really inexpensive so I was a little skeptical on what type of product I was getting I normally buy Apple products but needed something quick on a low budget and this is perfect It s great but for Google only Lightweight Great size I ve been using for awhile now and no issues I m happy with this purchase Product showed up on time Looks like brand new Love the device The unitmarrived quickly Took it out of the box and the first thing i noticed was it was very dirty the underside was covered in handprints and fingerprints Also noticed that it was not the same unit that was advertised One feature listed was a micro sd reade and this unit did nit have it The last item was it would not connect to a wifi network I did every diagnostic possible to inckude restting the device the router znd the modem and it would not accept the router key Every device i own is either refurbished or renewed and this was the first one i had any issues with Since tech support and other common sense troubleshooting items couldnt fix it i sent it back Wanted to replace a very old MacBook used for browsing while watching TV etc Didn t need anything high end obviously Just something to online shop pay a few bills and watch YouTube Purchased the Chromebook without a lot of research Mostly price and reviews After several months of use there aren t any negatives other than a dead pixel or two Impressed with overall speed and ease of use Would purchase again This was a gift I can t rate it but my granddaughter is very happy with it I love how fast it is and how clear the images are and the battery life is long enough to not have to charge it constantly but when I do charge it it does so fast I got it for personal use and future school work so it s exactly what I was looking for Was honestly expecting a unit with dings or scratches or looking refurbished The only way you know it is refurbished is because it does not come in original packaging VERY happy with this purchase so far Would recommend to others Excellent quality of material Super durable battery Very easy to use I am totally satisfied with my purchase I do not regret having done it I needed a cheaper laptop just for school purposes I wasn t expecting too much based of the reviews for more than a regular work laptop However this laptop is downplayed It can do a lot more and operates great The only issue I have is the screen flickering when it s about to die but you can clearly tell why This is not a touch screen Easy setup small and lightweight I had to return it because it had only one USB port Wow did this ever get here fast Impressive speedy shipping and delivery Very satisfied with the product so far I ve only had it a day so time will tell overall on how well it runs Thank you This laptop is a great starter laptop Its small and light weight The picture is great The battery lasts forever Very happy with this purchase Not enough technical hardware like CD player and extra USB connections FAR to dependendent on the cloud for storage Love loves it Very productive at home and on the go My kids needed them for school These are great for the money Good buy Light weight seems to be pretty easy to use Has a long battery life and completely charges in an hour or I also like the fact it has a charging port on the left and right side of it I am so happy that I took chance to make this purchase It arrived quickly and in pristine condition Workd great saves the environment as well and the need I have to have school on the go I was skeptical to buy a laptop for such a low price but I took the risk and bought it I cannot express how glad I am that I went for it It came in perfect condition and it blew me away Its the best laptop ive owned thus far Its easy to use has beautiful screen quality and very lightweight Its perfect for not only school and work but I can also play games on the google play store so ive had a lot of fun with that Overall its sleek speedy and super easy to use Our organizations didn t have enough computers for everybody so I purchased my own to leave at school First I received a really good looking machine It made a seamless transition to every program I needed to get my work done A battery charge lasts nearly the entire week I feel I got a good value for the money The chromebook itself is fine but the usb charger was bent I did a chat w amazon and they said they were shipping me a charger but it has not arrived yet I emailed the seller and they said to order another charger and they would refund me No thanks Sounds risky Order the new again almost worked perfectly but if the seller would have taken a quick glance they would have seen the bent usb plug Still no charger has arrived Great chromebook though Needed a laptop for school am happy I got it works perfectly light to carry around Good times It s really good for anything browser based but physically cannot download most apps and programs not even steam Had no idea that chrome books are not compatible with most apple and window programs If you want to have fun with a chrome book learn Linux This Laptop only has ONE USB port I repeat ONE I run a small business and I need a USB port for printer and label printer so this doesn t cut it will return However overall it s a pretty good laptop It is very nice We can watch Netflix videos etc You have to adjust the position in order to see a good image My daughter couldn t install the game she wanted to play Sorry don t know why has to do something with the system Great laptop when it worked nice size and touch screen BUT battery stopped charging after month of using it purchased another charger but that didn t make any difference This laptop is ok for the price but it has a few flaws It does not have an HDMI port so you cannot use it for presentations It only has USB port so you cannot use a mouse and a jump drive or printer at the same time all must be wireless And the new style charger that is similar to a phone charger breaks easily But if you just strictly need it to get online and do online schooling it s fine this is the second h p chromebook Iv e had in the last five years They are perfect for storage transporting and taking up very little space Like the look and light weight I use it at home for everything from internet to streaming movies games and you tube This refurbished chromebook has no noticeable difference from my original new chromebook Was a refurbished unit but works and looks like new Was a great price for as much as you get Battery life is about hours Way above my expectations Lightweight great battery life For my son school clases Great product my son loves it It really worked well for about two weeks The money was quickly refunded and I purchased a different one and have had no problem with it I needed a new computer to start college in the spring and was also on a budget Refurbished was good way to go for me and definitely couldn t beat the price I purchased the non touchscreen version I don t see that to be a necessary feature and I am very pleased with its performance battery life sleek design and light weight Highly recommend Its a basic Chromebook Nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do Internet searching emails and can stream amazon video Going to experiment with Google Docs and slides also For the money I think it was a great purchase All is good We have no complaints I had to buy these for work in an emergency they arrived early and saved a messy situation The chrome books are in perfect shape work superbly and have long enough battery life for our needs Plus they are full HD models I wasn t expecting that at this price point I d definitely get the same models from the same sellers again if needed Everything about the computer is great but the touchpad is glitching and with think I m clicking it when I m not The space bar will also freak out I ve tried a factory reset and doing research about the setting but nothing works I don t wanna waste my money on a mouse because you cant completely disable to touchpad It s definitely value for money GB is good enough for daily usage It is easy to use once you logged in It is the first chrome book that i have ever used It s easier than that i thought Size is good light to carry and slim which makes it looks good I didn t activate touch screen yet but seems like works good Satisfied Great buy Love it It a good little laptop Great price Low storage was immediately upgraded It came the next day no issues It came charged Set up was easy You d never know it was refurbished My pic is to give you an idea how big the screen is Clear pictures Runs fast So happy with this buy I was not sure I would like a Chromebook Quick start up Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate it s not that different from other formats You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card The only thing I can t do is a wireless connection to my printer Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day Thumbs up Love it and so easy to use Excellent I had my older laptop for last years and it come time to upgrade I did a research and with my needs of accomplish many tasks in browser I decided to purchase a Chromebook My order came without delay Chrome operation system include a lot of useful android applications I am very happy with my choice It looks new and is fast has a long battery life and is spot on what we needed Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use Can t beat the price for this level of computer We bought this product for my father in law as a gift He s a novice to say the least at technology and couldn t be more pleased with the product Company did a great job and it arrived two days after the purchase in a secure box and packaged to ensure no damage would take place I would definitely order from them again I loved what a super light device it is perfect for the homeschooler or if you are passionate about working at home from social media It s super thin you can carry it in your shopper style bag wherever you go It s good for price and work I like everything about the Chrome It is a very fast computer There was no problem and i hookup to my wifi easily It s great works good This computer arrived a couple of days late but looked brand new and was in perfect working order It s a great price so glad we found it Part of the review criteria says touch screen It s not a touch screen though or if it is that option isn t working Very great Works ok It is a used laptop It sounds good It works good Only this is the Facebook APP crashes But I can use the web browser for that and it feels better Overall stars Great quality and worth the money Really solid Chromebook for the price This was the only laptop that was in my very minimal budget that was x instead of x so I was afraid it would last in other areas but it s still pretty speedy for the specs Perfect for browsing and basic office work functions This is the perfect size for our kids to do school work my husband to do his work This is a great value the screen is clear lightweight computer fast and easy to connect to wifi Will be ordering more for my kids to do all their homeschool Great Value There s no touch screen features but it s lightweight and good price It is so light and very easy to use I am using it for work and it makes things so easy and fast to log in and get right to work The screen is very clear and easy to see everything It is great value for the money paid Great value for the money light weight everything you need in one computer Great for work or play Fast start up and shut down If you re looking for a computer that is light weight and can do it all this is it I would definitely buy this again Definitely worth it Got this little bad boy for my year old to participate in her online schooling and she s totally thriller Ideal for her and it s intended use and then some If I didn t purchase it myself I wouldn t have known it was renewed Fast for Chrome OS Small size and light weight for inch display Clear display quality Good sound of front pacing B O speakers Long battery Good keyboard and touchpad very good investment I loved it I have had this laptop since September everything is perfect except for when I am using my laptop camera to make content it goes out randomly then come back up Overall can mean my laptop is hacked possibly by the supplier or whomever It is extremely nerve wracking simply because this is a refurbished product and you never know what type of creeps are watching you Upon purchasing I will recommend getting it checked for bugs and making sure you re not being watched I was surprised how great this computer came out to be My son uses it for homeschool I definitely recommend it for as a student computer and to get the work done Picture quality can be a little bit better and low memory it s still great price for what I do with it I needed a new laptop for the upcoming semester and this one is exactly what I needed It came in great condition and the speakers are amazing Not to mention it is a great price I purchased as a gift I did not realize it was refurbished when I purchased That being said the overall computer works well for the purposes my husband needs it and he is enjoying it My favorite about this new computer is that now I can play games with my friends online It also helps me with my art projects for inspiration and stuff Great value for the money I was more than happy with the computer I received It came in a very timely manner and was in good shape very pleased will definitely recommend Great product Great laptop and came like new Everything is working great after many weeks I am impressed and recommend it The packaging was very secured The chromebook and charger feels and operate like new i got it in a timely manner Do not hesitate to buy The HP Chromebook is an excellent multi purpose laptop It can be used for researching online budgeting and finances games music and movies Shopping for anything needed for the entire family Taking classes on line or for homework for students This is not a touchscreen chromebook It served the purpose that I bought it for For my son that will be attending high school This is just the right size and weight Came out the box looking and performing brand new Very easy set up and downloads Got it for some class work Great value for the price Would buy it again Absolutely love this product looks just like the picture Comes in great packaging Works well for personal use or work Over all I loved it terms of service apparently if u cant hit the agree to tos u r not gonna use the pc couldnt load data fluke possibly but never chrome again Everything is fine

happy with the purchase and price Also delivery was made in days and packaging was tight Very happy Perfect for home schooling very nice computer Light weight beautiful clear screen Great value

this product for its battery life OMG I absolutely L O V E this computer It was so easy to set up and so light weight I am borderline OBSESSED I needed a Chromebook for work and bought this one So surprised at how good it actually is Money well spent I love this computer It is a great buy It was very easy to set up It a gift for me year old I love this computer It is very nice Works great for being a year old It s not a laptop It s basically a tablet with a keyboard I read a bunch of reviews before buying but this model is older than the one I read about figuring it would all be relatively the same It s not It s a glorified tablet that MOST apps will not work on I bought an external disc drive so I could load a program on to it but it s not supported That should be the chromebook slogan This program is not supported Should have paid for a real laptop I am very pleased with this product My son is a freshmen in college and this is perfect for him I like it The size is bigger than I thought It was easy to set up Perfect for what I need to do The computer is small and light weight It s perfect for my college student to carry around campus and use in class Very happy with this

top serves my purpose in retrieving all the information I need Easy to set up and use right away Charges very fast It is also lightweight and slim Just like new money well spent EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT COMES IN A VERY WELL PROTECTED BOX ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY IN COLOMBIA HIGHLY RECOMMENDED EXCELLENT SELLER I liked the size and weight of the laptop It s easy to carry and easy to move Currently using product for school Product is awesome Satisfied customer While trying to input my password I noticed the E wasn t working After trying countless times it simply would not work Then after testing all the letters I noticed the S and D also did not work It s obviously essential for all keys to work when using a laptop so this was extremely disappointing and I wouldn t suggest you waste your money Testing something so quick and essential such as the keyboard seems like a pretty logical thing to do before selling a refurbished product It s an external issue should have been as easy fix and never released to be sold in such condition Returning and purchasing with a different company light weight good value easy to use Setting it up is a breeze Highly recommend Looks brand new acts brand new great pc at a great price Cheaply made and an inferior designed case Worked great was what I wanted and was a great deal for the price The person using this only gets on the internet That is exactly

Great laptop for the money Nice and lightweight I m really starting to question Amazons refurbished junk yard The quality is exactly that JUNK dont waste your money buying or even considering buying returned refurbished junk ITS NOT WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND AMAZON DONT GIVE A FLYING HOOT Even new products from Amazon are failing as they are letting the slim in to sell you their junk inventory and there isn t a damn thing you can do about it Don t even get me started on rd party sellers JUST STAY AWAY IS YOUR BEST BET I bought of them the first one was ok keeping figures crossed that it stays that way the second one refuse to come on I m currently traveling with a none functional chrome book I would advise against buying this chrome book you might get a busted one like I did I contacted Amazon Support who sent me to the Manufacture Support who indicated there is nothing that can be done and I have to return the item for a refund The laptop was purchased renewed Be careful who you purchase from Mine was severely compromised and infected all of my androids I suggest to thoroughly inspect it first and if something seems out of the norm return item immediately Such as logging in and out Be safe and spend a few xtra dollars on a new one if you can I wish I would of Just a warning I m sure not all of the sellers are untrustworthy but the few that are Beware Screen has lines in an it s not touch screen an it s like a s computer but good for very basic laptop I m returning it need clear picture I received the laptop but cant use it as its asked as soon as i turned it on it asked for my bank credit card details to purchase memory as its saying its reached memory limit hmm how can that be as i only just switched it on not happy as i only purchased this laptop to talk to relatives on facebook living in england def been ripped off folks The laptop looks nice but the keyboard doesn t work Don t waste your money This is not the one for me Decided I don t like Chromebook and went back to my windows laptop I had to return it and Amazon made it amazingly easy So I am in my late twenties and plan to go back to school to finish my schooling I could not afford a Mac so I wanted to see if this would be a great fit Well I love it It s light weight it looks modern for a Chromebook and it s in amazing condition It was delivered on time and the price is unbelievable This is a great purchase for students It s not the fanciest computer but it will get the job done Merry Christmas everyone Cheap bare minimum almost not worth it Save frustration Just buy an unused brand new computer The money is better spent This computer was exactly what I needed for work Great price and does what I need it to i carry it wherever i go it is the best laptop i have ever used This Chromebook is really fast easy to navigate Excellent battery life I can add more users no more small phone screen for all my apps Can used anywhere it s like carrying a small notebook Really amazing with the unit and the fast delivery For now I don t see a thing that makes me dislike this laptop I love the color it s slim light to carry so far it s perfect for me I only use it for browsing Netflix and you tube Works great I have an old printer espon and it wasn t up dated on the espon app I would reconmend this computer to anyone it does what i need it to do This Product is a Great Product however the internet drops whenever i use Microsoft Teams Doesn t support enough apps in the play store but for the price it does what the bare minimum of what a laptop needs to do Overall it s a decent laptop for the price it offers wasn t what I was expecting though I ve had no issues with it and the battery lasts all day for me I bought it for college It doesn t have a backlit keyboard but everything else is excellent on it Love this laptop its my first and its worth every penny my laptop looks brand new I am in love with the final product I recieved The device i slightweight and compact and does exactly what I need it to do I did receive the product late but I m certain that was a postal issue Great product from a great company I highly recommend this product for a student or teacher who is looking for a good work horse computer Great buy I purchased this for my son and he loves it It is great value for the money Looks and feels brand new no visible imperfections close up or held at arms length Screen is crisp sound is clear and the webcam and mic works great Light weight and a great value for the money I loved the product it s super good The package arrived beaten and the screen therefore broke The guarantee allowed me a full refund of the money I chose the wrong product I would have preferred a pc with windows since I have never worked with a Chromebook with OS before It has killed my production I would love to exchange this unit for something that I am more familiar with You advertised this as a touch screen and it s not I got it for my elderly grandma and now it s basically a faster version of the last laptop she had trouble using If I wanted a good laptop I d say it s a good purchase but I paid for something else For what I paid and what I got it far exceeded my expectations Lightweight with a long battery life If you are looking for a notebook that delivers the HP Flagship has everything you are looking for I bought this for my son is light weight has a decent amount of storage and will get the job done if using it for school He is in high school so school papers it is good enough for U will need a cord to hook to a printer It looks like a brand new product Everything is perfect except the power button is not really responsive star for this product Easy to set up Works great Looks great Great price Happy with purchase it s okay it doesn t have touch screen but could have one more usb port Worked perfect out of the box Was packaged well Like the product and works well for what I needed It shipped fast and arrived early Looks brand new No problems so far so good Thanks works great great price Nice The item was supreme and prime Quality of the wrapping was rad Immensely speedy delivery Service was grand Like new that s why I repeated It s a good product for school children easy to control from parents end using family link I thought I was buying into a cheap laptop But NOPE Works awesome and never let me down Would of been great to have touchscreen Works great I love it Great Brand New No scratches or anything like Used mark Work without problem and very fast really good chrome book battery life is insanely good anywhere from hours on a charge and the p screen is great and it can play k youtube with no problem which is awesome really great condition also looked like it was never used stars definitely recommend Great for my use I m retired and use my computer for saving and creating personal docs More than enough computer for personal use or young students At a great price First day with it and I can already yell it is just going g to get the bare minimum done But the bare minimum is all I really need I guess However I can t help but feel that a could be better spent on another laptop It s great it works very well and at an excellent price Very nice It arrived very well packaged due to its characteristics it is a very well optimized Chromebook in addition to the fact that it is aesthetically very beautiful elegant and super thin in the description it indicates it has a Celeron processor but reviewing it it has a pentium N with cores and with its gb of ram It works perfectly for office automation multimedia video games etc you can edit your documents in Googledocs or Office the only thing is that in the description it says with a Backlit keyboard and it is not like that it has Wi Fi and Bluetooth the keyboard comes without the but It s no problem you just use Alt n on the extended US keyboard so as not to lose the configuration A device that is worth one hundred for what you pay and although it is renovated it comes with new aesthetics and functionality and with updates until June I think you can do a little more with this laptop going from the average user totally recommended for office work school and video games Excellent buy It is very pretty practical and comfortable besides that for its price it does not ask others The only problem is that I am a teacher and I use word and power point etc And with this computer it has been difficult for me to work in drive and in applications similar to the windos package because they are not the same and sometimes they are limited I have used it for about a month and a half I have liked it a lot and it has exceeded my expectations It is light fast easy to use very good resolution It connects to easy WiFi And fast and also from my cell phone they are linked Honestly I am not very skilled in new technology issues however using Google documents as a word processor power point presentations or video conferences in meet or zoom has been very easy for me to use I can move it and take it on a trip it weighs little it is a good size like a professional notebook The Mac type cover is made of aluminum I read some reviews since they always help me decide my purchase that s why I did the same I highly recommend it I arrive perfectly packaged earlier than expected Thank you Good for elementary school kids jobs Chromebooks are really good products This one has a fast startup like rocket fast compared to windows long battery life recommended product This is the second submission of this review after the first submission was rejected by amazon for not meeting guidelines Almost unbelievable easy to use and complements my daughter s study I am very happy with my purchase the laptop works without problems I had my doubts because it was a renewed article but it convinced me a lot quality price is excellent I highly recommend it I bought this item for home school for one of my children the chromebook is super practical and easy for children to use ideal for home school I loved I bought it to work from home I ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it has run everything quite smoothly The laptop is a chromebook so it doesn t have windows the advantage is that it comes with linux so the operating system already has me convinced to start programming and that s very good for me Price quality ratio it is excellent super fast and I use it to create documents and teach online it works great for me It does not have a windows operating system but it is very fast functional the design is very good since it is very light Impeccable but the keyboard and mousepad are lenses and do not seem to be of premium quality especially when you come from using a Macbook all your life everything from an Android cell phone is literally on a laptop what you do on a cell phone you will Being able to do on this computer that with your ChromeOS is going to have its limitations I arrive like new impeccable and I will proceed to return it because it is not fast only to pay and to turn it on I like everything about this computer it was a dream to set up and connect to the Internet it is extremely sleek and portable the casing is very attractive A perfect choice for a student or a busy housewife Perfect function Amazon you are the best I asked you for a smaller lap and you gave me a bigger one The tears in my daughter s eyes when receiving her gift are priceless It is very light the sound is very good the image is very clear the keyboard is in English but it is super fast I loved it Good product excellent sound does not weigh much I arrive earlier than expected I quite liked it I liked the quality in addition to the fact that the specifications that come in the product are the real ones Good product arrived in estimated time Great functionality and price The battery lasts a long time Good product for basic computing uses easy to adapt operating system good sound good resolution Very good value for money It is very versatile it runs very well as it is a chromebook you don t need so much memory if you are used to another operating system you get used to it in an organic way great product recommended for work and leisure it is not a gaming lap Excellent size image resolution and quality It was a gift for my daughter s graduation and we loved it It is very light I loved the color and very easy to program and use I recommend it Excellent product good quality good price It broke my expectations I was expecting something of lower quality but it is an excellent tool It is very worth it Light easy to use excellent value for money Wonderful It is very light and practical I loved Good device fair payment for what it provides A very good computer for a very affordable price'"

       "'It was running smooth for the first month or so I had it, and then randomly after booting up a certain steam game it would always randomly turn off the screen and leave the actual computer on. I couldn\\'t turn the screen back on I had to restart the whole laptop. It would happen about 3 times per actual game playing session. And then I noticed it was way slower when booting up after not being used for a while. It would sit on desktop and take 3 minutes to open either Spotify, steam, google, or anything. And today it gave me the blue screen of death. I never downloaded anything fishy, just steam games Spotify and then I browsed YouTube every now and then. I remember buying a laptop from bestbuy like 3 years ago for 400$ cad and it was almost as fast as this laptop which is 1400& cad. I mean the laptop worked again after I restarted it a few times, which is good. It still sorta works. But who knows how much worse it will get over time. Might just return it instead of getting a tech guy to fix it if I can. Received the item and during setup it stopped working and went to a black screen. When contacting the seller they want me to pay to ship it back.... it doesn\\'t work why am I paying to ship it back...... Terrible to send out a computer that has been sent back before and not even checked???? little expensive Haven\\'t had a chance to play with it yet. I\\'m s long time HP user so I don\\'t think I will be disappointed. I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work. Dont listen to these other reviews. Love the colour. Great price.\\nCons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.\\nSpeaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won\\'t even allow me to add my school email. Slow for download but still work well for my kids to do homework I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Working to help other in need. Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Supplier said they would credit $20 for return shipping. It will cost more than $95 to return from Mexico. Item never worked. Who checks these out? They should be fired! I am so disappointed! Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. I had to return it because it would not turn in ! I’m very sad. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ Don’t waste your money on this computer it’s trash SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. It works , not too slow Working to help other in need.

Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Black screen. No charging. No screws to even open it to unplug the batter...it\\'s junk. You pay for what you get. garbage...right this moment. In my trash. I like the quality and feel for the price, it was $130 and feels expensive and does everything a chromebook should. Affordable for working remotely Within a week of receiving this product, the touchpad would randomly stop working. After a while, it would start working again. This seemed to happen randomly with it working for hours then not working for hours. Since it was within the 30 days, I returned it for a full refund.\\n\\nHowever, the company stated that this touchpad is working find and only gave me a partial refund because of the restocking fee. After asking them if they looked only briefly or for a while, like my reason stated, they refused to even provide an answer. They only pointed towards Amazon customer service to ask for a full refund for me. Luckily, Amazon customer service covered the difference without any hassle.\\n\\nDon\\'t support SkyNetWorks. My excitement for getting a Chromebook to still study and write when I\\'m too sick/tired to sit up was dampened considerably when this got here.\\n\\nBasically, something is wrong with the screen. Not just in this one - the issue is still present even in the replacement that Amazon sent. It seems to have a problem with skin in particular, along with pale colors, and using the built-in \"night light\" feature or Screen Shader extension on Chrome to reduce blue light makes it worse. When watching videos, people will commonly have huge blotches of green pixels along their skin. And in normal windows, green lines and splotches will often appear for no reason at all.\\n\\nInitially I tried talking to HP Support about the issue, and they actually tried to foist me off on a \"specialist\" that I would have to pay for - to get help on a brand new Chromebook that I hadn\\'t even had for an hour yet! Thankfully Amazon support was more reasonable, and they simply offered to set up a return and send me a replacement in the meantime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue is persisting even in the replacement. I can only assume it\\'s a common defect in this model now, maybe in some awful push to try and get people to buy the newer and more expensive one. Don\\'t waste your money or time - get a different Chromebook, from a different brand! UPDATE: so I returned the first one. Which I paid only $90 for it. Reordered another one; then got charged $119 plus tax for it, it still has not been shipped. Just looked at them again and now they’re asking $129 plus tax. Is this a scam???\\n\\nI just got this chrome book/laptop, and put it to charge. 3 hours later it is still dead. So frustrating. After 5 month the battery no longer taking the charge , barely used it . It’s frustrating when you trust and purchased an item and then it stop working . Whats even worst is its very costly to return items. Hoping. Someone can contact me . I had this for less than a year, too late to return, but not worth the $144 I spent for it - I took it in to have serviced, and the Geek Guy told me it is the mother board. Thought it may still be under warranty. I am going to try to get it serviced Had a hard time connecting to the internet. I rebooted, reset, troubleshoot, tech support and YouTube, nothing work. Returned the Chromebook. Looking for something different. I must have gotten a bad one. The screen would have green squiggly lines when the background was white. Don\\'t waste your $$$ after 2 weeks it no longer connects to wifi It is not for someone who is computer illiterate like the person who I sent it. They can\\'t get past the set up. I barely used this because it was intended to be a back-up for travel. Kept it permanently plugged into wall socket and used once in awhile. Last week tried to boot up and it is completely blank screen - no power. Tested wall socket with other items it was fine. Tried plugging into other sockets, still dead. Now have to hassle with manufacturer warranty! Only been using it for 5 days and this morning it won’t turn on or even charge. Piece of junk. Definitely not worth it. I have no idea why this has 4.6 stars for gaming it can’t even run a simple iPhone game without crashing or absolutely frying the inside.\\n\\nAlthough it’s not for gaming. Basically the only thing this is useful for is browsing the internet and MAYBE streaming. It’s actual price is 50$ maybe even less. I ordered 2 of theses for my grandsons. They are very disappointed with the speed of the device and often describe it as being glitchy. I would like to return them since they don’t use them. How can I return this product? Opened this less than a month ago. The screen goes black and you have to turn it off and on until you can get it to work. Unfortunately ordered early for boyfriends birthday so can\\'t return. Don\\'t waste your money. I got this for my mom for her birthday and it turned on once. Now it won’t turn on again even though we have charged it up. I never make reviews or complain about anything but just know (because I did not look into the return policy) you CANNOT RETURN. My fault for not reading that but it still sucks I bought a computer that doesn’t work. I’d recommend not buying from them and buying from another company because yours may not work either. Could not connect to Wi-Fi at Starbucks, 2 different McDonald’s, Kinko’s, or from 2 different Wi-Fi’s at an AT&T store. My phone had full Wi-Fi bars at each locale. Was finally able to connect at a laundromat. Wi-Fi sucks so I’m disappointed. Its a good laptop as long as you don\\'t want to download anything, download the GOOGLE play store or even finish setting up the stupid thing because it can\\'t connect connect my wifi. Even though everything else does. Tried to trouble shoot. Don\\'t waste your money We did not have a password saved and were unable to get support from the company to help us set one up. Now we cannot get into the machine and it is useless. Do not purchase. This computer does not work at all it’s either frozen or shutting down. Called customer support and all they had me do was turn it on and off over and over. It came defective, screen said Chrome OS missing or damaged. Couldn’t get it to work. Bought June 28 screen malfunction August 19, called company no support offered at all. Very disappointed they would not stand by their product. Cost to fix was more than I paid For it. The screen is broken, will have to be replaced. It can only be used for very simple work. The screen resolution and brightness is bad. It become very slow while multiply programs run together. Obviously not new! Pretty disappointed right now. I love everything about this laptop besides the fact that everytime I use it, it keeps shutting off and turning back on at least a few times and I’m not sure why. My Chromebook lasted a whopping two years. It was difficult to scroll and impossible to update the apps. I am pretty sure they are designed to go kaput after two years. If anyone can recommend a good small lightweight laptop please let me know! After using the Chromebook for less than 2 years I got the dreaded \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged\" message. I tried to use the \"recovery disk\" as suggested on numerous sites but to no avail. Took it to Geek Squad where they worked on it for over a week before giving it up as a lost cause. The Chromebook is scrap. The operating system is unstable and cannot be relied on. Do yourself a favour and get a computer or or tablet with a real operating system. I bought this laptop for my sister and it took over 15 mins to start up. We have great Wi-Fi connection and I did not expect this from Awful performance from an HP laptop. Buyers Beware! I’m stuck with this junk of a laptop. Wish I could give 0 stars. Horrible customer service also. This will be a back up computer as we needed it in case one of the ones that we have now goes down. Unfortunately wasn\\'t what I needed but great small computer for small jobs. Still buying HP just bigger 😁 Everything not complete Haven\\'t had a chance to play with it yet. I\\'m s long time HP user so I don\\'t think I will be disappointed. I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work. Dont listen to these other reviews. Love the colour. Great price.\\nCons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.\\nSpeaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won\\'t even allow me to add my school email. Slow for download but still work well for my kids to do homework I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Working to help other in need. Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Supplier said they would credit $20 for return shipping. It will cost more than $95 to return from Mexico. Item never worked. Who checks these out? They should be fired! I am so disappointed! Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. I had to return it because it would not turn in ! I’m very sad. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ Don’t waste your money on this computer it’s trash SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Laptop arrived on time, and properly packaged! This laptop has exceeded my expectations thus far. Will followed up with a durability review after a few months of use. The \"Watchdog violation\" has been seen on Window\\'s stop code extraction. Did just a Windows update (Win11) procedure. The only third-party software installed to the moment is the Googe Drive. Yet don\\'t know the root of problem. The hard fault happened on Wi-Fi connection changing from established 5G to 2.5G within same router area. Although I like the compact size of the laptop, the absence of a calculator type numeric keypad is an inconvenience when dealing with several numbers. Purchased device in August. One morning in November, upon trying to start the computer, the screen would stay completely black. Trouble shooting showed the original 8GB of Samasung Ram had failed. Because I had added a second stick of 8GB ram (A-Tech 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz SODIMM PC4-25600 (PC4-3200AA) CL22 Non-ECC Laptop RAM Memory Module), HP would not warranty it. Just ordered a second stick from A-Tech. Make of this what you will. Bought this one for our son thats attending ASU for engineering. Added another 8G memory stick and this thing is a very capable workhorse. I need one for work travel and look forward to using it daily. Don\\'t hesitate on hitting the button. You will not be disappointed. I just wanted a laptop to pass the time but I was shocked by the quality of graphics and the benefit of such a light weight laptops mobility Have to reboot all the time as internet is slow when all the other devices in the house are fine Bought in May. In July, the unit boots up but the screen remains blank. Terrible support from Amazon and HP. Was initially told by an Amazon agent that I could have a replacement or refund no problem, but that agent ghosted us. Had to contact Amazon again and that agent put us in touch with HP. The HP agent put us through an hour and a half of ineffectual diagnostics before telling us we\\'d have to send it in for repair. So we won\\'t have use of this machine for another two weeks at least. And that\\'s assuming they can fix it! Please just give us our money back Amazon and HP! Quit wasting everyone\\'s time! Didn\\'t even last a year. First it kept disconnecting from internet every 5 minutes. Whereas my other laptop was fine. Then after 6 months it would not charge! No help from anyone and of course no warranty. Stay away from this horrible laptop! When the computer isn\\'t plugged in, the laptop won\\'t turn on. If you fully charge it, then put it to sleep..When you open it the next day the battery will be dead and it won\\'t turn on. What good is a laptop if it always has to be plugged in? Useless. Trying to figure out how to contact HP about the one year warranty. It\\'s ridiculous how hard they make it.\\n\\nFlat out, I would not recommend this or buy this laptop again. I loved it until it would not turn on one day. Took it to get checked out amd they said the motherboard went bad? Serious shortest time ever with a computer. moderate to heavy typing is only doable if you type \"blind\" or you have a detached key that shows the letters clearly. this is the worse computer I\\'ve ever had...I the middle of setting up it froze and it been 5 hours and I can\\'t shut it down...and cant get up hpI\\'ve callHP and he was it still can;yt get it started...terrible product I did not get a 8gb. It was 4gb, blue, and extremely slow. The entire laptop felt like a child\\'s toy. The screen was impossible to see. The quality overall was horrendous. I love HP, but was beyond disappointed with this product. This computer has me waiting 30 minutes just to search up something, the color is very trashy gray and dull, it is also false advertisement of 256 gbs of storage. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. Really poor quality right from the start. Computer is tricky to get to reliably turn on. Flimsy and breaks from falling less than 2 ft on a carpeted floor :-( HP will not honor any repair on accidental damage. My laptop was less than a month old when it happened. I sent it to them and HP quoted $619 to repair my $500 laptop. I will never buy HP again. I\\'m a Gmail guy I have a Gmail account I don\\'t want to change.....good luck getting past all the Microsoft monopoly malware to install chrome as a browser...super slow also Thought I bought the windows 11 version, but I guess not. And I didn’t realize this was the 2009 model…. Very disappointing. Bought/Set this up for a family member who just needed a very basic laptop. Laptop works fine but was disappointed that it doesn\\'t actually come with Windows 11 already loaded. It boots and gets you connected to the Internet and THEN it downloads and installs Windows 11. Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn\\'t going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn\\'t expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can\\'t find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn\\'t think I\\'d need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where\\'s the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn\\'t look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won\\'t run unless I\\'m connected to the internet. What? How\\'s that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I\\'m giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!! The battery is really bad it lasts only 2 hours for new PC is really bad Everything I expected If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it\\'s pretty good I use this laptop for both work and personal things. So far, no issues. My only (small) complaint is that it runs a little loud. I want to say is this is not a touch screen, which is so disappointing i absolutely cannot get used the touch pad. I have tried to no avail. I didn\\'t realize it was touch pad or i would kept looking its terrible .missed my return window Although everything else is good ,just really not able to use it Dumps wifi driver and requires hard reset at least twice a week. I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.\\n\\nFast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We\\'ve been using Dell but I figured I\\'d save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She\\'s had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP\\'s quality issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately I can\\'t return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it\\'s time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.\\n\\nI\\'m giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand. Was not happy with the quality of screen, viewing was not crisp and clear. I thought I could live without a back-lit keyboard, but it is impossible to see the keys clearly because the characters, letters, numbers are very thin and almost the same color as the keys....especially if you don\\'t have 20/20 vision. I found this computer, for the money, only average compared to what I have owned before. Disappointed that there is not a DVD player. Why wasn’t I told this? My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys. I bought this for my wife, who teaches English at a small university in Zimbabwe. She LOVES it!! She doesn\\'t game with it, so doesn\\'t need a super-fast computer. She loves the solid feel and the quick reactions. So far it does everything she needs to do with it. I like this laptop, but it is hard to see the letters on the keys. You can barely see them standing straight overtop the keyboard. I wish I had returned it, but I\\'ve already downloaded personal stuff on it. Unhappy that it had error messages when starting and then connectivity problems after that. Came without a Windows 11 CD so I can\\'t fix driver issues Only reason I ordered this one above other similar ones was because of the 1080p screen. I had no idea 1080p quality could be so lacking. IF you can handle a blurry/fuzzy display, this one is for you. Just love how fast it boots up fast which is what I was looking for.\\nHowever, this one\\'s connectivity is not good. First, I have had a few Wifi disconnects I don\\'t have on my previous HP or have with my phone on the same desk. I would never buy a computer w/o an ethernet outlet ever again. This one\\'s ports do not handle flash drive or camera media cards on its ports all so well. The media card is hard to remove and one got damaged: the little plastic slide to indicate write protected fell off. I have to tug hard to remove a USB. Also it doesn\\'t read some of my USB\\'s. I hope my old HP holds up. If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee. Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks I\\'ve had the computer for almost a year without too many issues. I just can\\'t \"connect to the internet.\" HP is uesless. I tried to contact them, but never had any luck. I tried their worthless program they install on the computer, but I can\\'t use it because I am not connected to the internet. I am using the laptop to write this, yet...somehow I am not connected to the internet. I will never buy another HP again. Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick. This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.\\n\\nIt feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.\\n\\nThe keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.\\n\\nOn the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.\\n\\n1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months\\n2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.\\n3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.\\n4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.\\n\\nThe quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.com\\n\\nThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing. The battery is simply horrible. I have to recharge every evening. Sending it back The laptop has to be shut off and restarted. NO USING the RESTART function either. I have to shut it down, wait a bit, then start it for the WIFI to reappear. All work is lost! And, you can not add anything to the task bar! All the sites I frequently use, can not be dragged & added. WTH? I have had this laptop less then 24 hours and I absolutely HATE IT! The worst experience I have before with electronic devices, computer break down within the period of warranty, went to suggested spot, the technician saying have to break it down to fix but HP doesn\\'t responsible at all. DONT PURCHASE THIS, go to grab a apple computer, definitely more expensive but worth more This computer is garbage. It\\'s slow, it\\'s cannot process. Cr2 photo files. It cannot process basic photoshop programs. It\\'s slow, I have to restart it constantly, and the screen colors are off. Do not waste your money on this! Update: Amazon made this right by offering to take this back past the return time. My friend did find a back up he made and was able to restore. That being said HP warranty was worthless. i bought this as a gift..it has had several issues..most related to disconnecting to internet although it is connected by ethernet...yesterday it crashed..we got it so far as to a PIN screen. You are unable to click any links they give you to move forward..two hours on outsourced support from HP wherein they determine it is a password issue..Mind you the computer recognizes the user but it frozen in a screen asking you to set up a PIN...support is clueless and will not give you any links to make warranty claim...sent me a link to buy a support contract.....WHILE this is under warranty..total outsourcing BS by HP why i myself use a MAC not any windows product...a birthday gift that became my problem. argh I had high hopes because I didn’t see the reviews until after I made the purchase. At that point I could only hope I wouldn’t have the same Wi-Fi issues that most other people had complained about. But sure enough, the 2nd day, after the laptop installed updates, I could not get it to connect to wifi anymore. I rebooted and tried to fix it for a little while but after reading the reviews I tried no more troubleshooting as I already knew what to expect but just hoped for a different outcome. Sending the laptop back immediately and I will just go and purchase one in store that I won’t have to troubleshoot on day two. Do not waste your time with this laptop unfortunately. And to think this was on the “Treasure Truck” but there is no treasure here. I never write reviews. Ever. But I am so disappointed after having this laptop for 4 months, the wifi stopped working. Nothing even shows up for connections. The touchpad/mouse is also not great to use, it is very touchy and ends up doing really strange things. Bought this as a Prime day deal gift for my husbands Birthday. The laptop would not power on or charge. I went through the trouble shooting instructions provided when I went to do a return (replacement was not an option offered). Only option for return is UPS pickup or pay for the return myself. I wasn\\'t sent a tracking number or a label so I could not take it to the UPS store or call UPS to reschedule when we were not home for the 1 pick up attempt. I had to cancel then resubmit the return to hopefully return this $500 paperweight. I bought this computer at the end of April and have used it maybe 10 times and I ALWAYS have an issue with being able to log in, keeps kicking me out, now the battery won\\'t charge and won\\'t work unless it\\'s plugged in. To make matters worse I tried to install the updates to see if that would help the battery and now it won\\'t let me sign in at all. Keeps looping back to the sign on screen. Don\\'t waste your money! The laptop has been doing this the second week I got it. It loses the capability to connect to Wi-Fi and then tells you to connect to Ethernet. Which I can’t because it doesn’t have an Ethernet port. So every time we have to reset the laptop to factory settings in order for it to work\\nDo I have warranty? So my first one broke. HP replaced it. Second one broke. My insurance replaced it. Third one is now broken. Do not buy this laptop. Same problem every time. The touch screen and volume stop working then the screen just goes black. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!! The computer touchpad is terrible. very sensitive and it goes all over the place. The audio jack already stopped working. Always have issuing with WI-FI connections. None of my other computers have that concern. The quality is not worth it. Awkward to use. crosshair attaches to anything it gets close to. I don\\'t want a computer deciding what I am doing. Highlights text at most inopportune times, not at my direction. Frustrating to use. Ikons too small. Purchased this laptop in November 2021. It is still under warranty but the HP website lists repair sites of UbreakIfit it. None of these sites would repair connectivity issues under the warranty. Spent three hours online with HP support tech and still unable to access the internet. We\\'ve always been satisfied with HP devices - no longer! The Amazon support CS did NOT offer to help provide a three way call to HP to fix the issue just gave us the HP 800 number. Sorry we purchased this laptop thru Amazon. It is slow and web pages \"jitter\" and takes forever to load. Not worth the price I purchased this laptop on Jun 13th and it was delivered on Jun 15th, which is the day warranty should start. HP sent a mail asking for feedback mail, in which it recognizes the purchase date to be around Jun 15th. However, when we check the warranty date, it starts on Nov 25th, 2021 (and ends warranty support Dec 29th, 2022)\\n\\nWe have tried reaching HP seller support twice to fix this, but they have still not fixed the warranty start date. this laptop has some wifi issues. when it comes back on after sleep, wifi often does not work. you will have to reboot it. this is really inconvenient. every time you close your laptop there is a high chance that you\\'ll end up having to restart the computer. sometimes, you\\'ll have to reboot it again and again until the wifi works. I am currently traveling, and this is really frustrating. I missed the return window, and I cannot even get any warranty service until I get back home. I am afraid it\\'s getting worse and it may not last until the end of my trip.. very frustrating... I’m a college student and I purchased this computer about two weeks ago. The only purpose of this computer was to do homework, I don’t download games, I don’t even use social media on this computer, all I was supposed to do was homework. Turns out I wasn’t even able to do homework!!! It keeps shutting itself off and making loud and weird sounds, keeps showing a blue screen saying that “the device ran into a problem and it needs to restart”. I tried to contact customer support but they couldn’t help me at all, I was trying to do homework and all of a sudden (after about 25 mins of homework) a blue screen shows again saying it needs to restart and IT HAS BEEN STUCK at 43% for the past hour. Worst computer ever! I’m returning and never purchasing again! mouse pad began to malfunction in first 60 days. It gets stuck when pressed, and I never spilled anything on it. Very annoying! I bought this for my wife. Ever since we have had it (3 months) it doesn’t connect to wi-fi.\\nI have luck connecting about 10 times finally over that period. Amazon will not do anything about it because they say the 30 day return policy is up. We use our phone most days for everything, but on occasion we need the laptop. Very disappointed in this product and do not recommend purchasing. Basically what I’m saying is they sold me a POS laptop that was supposedly new but I have to send it in to get it fixed??? Never had so many issues with a laptop before. Contacted HP numerous times and instead of acknowledging the laptop has an issue, they kept trying to restart it, reflash the OS, etc. with weeks of back and forth as it would work for a few days before disappearing again. worst part is after all of this time and no lasting solution, the return option on Amazon is gone, and HP is saying thats how we have to get it replaced. I would have expected better from HP... Do not recommend at all. Technically the laptop itself meets my needs, but the resident programming sucks. I do not like nor use McAfee, and having their annoying popups every few seconds makes me hate it.\\nI\\'ve gone into Control Panel to delete the program, but the popups persist. Power on and off . Just horrible product Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall. The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money! This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!! Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !! I\\'m a casual home user. This unit is awful. I don\\'t know the verbiage, but I\\'ve had nothing but problems since my purchase 2+ months ago. I still have my old HP PC which still works, it\\'s at least 10 yrs old. I\\'m done w HP. After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend. WiFi adapter is dead. Return window went out just over a month ago. Literally had this stupid thing for 5 months and now it’s useless. Only used for writing papers in word and uploading for school assignments. Avoid HP like the plague.\\n\\nUpdate 4/23/22: They were able to walk through a repair with customer support. That worked....for awhile. Now the wifi adapter is dead again... I thought it was a good deal for the amount of horse power this computer has, so I bought two of them. within the first few weeks both laptops’ network cards failed, and they\\'re unable to connect to wifi. So we\\'ve had to use usb wifi dongles. Would not recommend this product. I have bought this laptop for my business associate. As he was traveling he didn\\'t have a chance to set it up. we were trying to do now but neither wifi nor bluetooth are responding. Amazon told me 30 days passed and dismissed me. Truly bad experience. Not a great experience. The product didn\\'t work right from the beginning. It would kick off in the middle of an application and it would shut down wifi. Also, it was difficult to turn and off. This HP 15-inch Laptop is very bad product. It has wifi adapter compatibility problems. The wifi asapter is incompatible with windows 11 operating system & does not connect to the internet. It has a problem with internet connections and going dead all the time. I would give it no Stars Product failed. Hardware not working. Needed it to be ready to start grad school for my daughter this week. Would not recommend. Very disappointed. Now I have to return and buy another laptop for her first week of school. Hard to set up program and keeps updating after loading loosing information. This laptop has completely shut down and when it actually turns on now it looks like in the attached photo.\\nVery disappointed with this purchase. The wifi settings disappeared and i thought i was crazy until i had my coworker look and she notice the wifi setting wasnt there either. This laptop was defective. I returned it the very next day. I have to do a hard reboot regularly. Known problem, terrible customer support Not a good laptop stop working in less than a year welp had trouble connecting to internet did total restart now its suck on wifi screen will not go any further\\nwant to send back Whenever windows 11 updates, the wifi icon disappears so it is impossible to connect to the internet. There also is no Ethernet port. It was loaded with the wrong operating system. I would never buy this again. I just opened it and found the damage done to corners of this laptop. Poor quality management. SSD failed about 4 months into using this item. cannot return or replace. money down the toilet. I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it\\'s NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me, & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #\\'s, etc with other places before buying here. Very disappointed, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t even get that. Very fast and powerful machine but onboard wifi failed after only two weeks of operation. Very disappointing. Getting mentally prepared for the warranty repair hassles. Update: decided buying a wifi dongle was a better option then wiping data, being without it for two weeks and having to set it up again. windows 11 = bad This laptop worked fine for about a month. It took me a while to transfer data, install Google accounts, and other software. One day, I sat down to use it and the internet was not available. When you click on the ball to see you internet options - that screen is gone. I took it to a trusted computer repair store, and he said the laptop is not acknowledging that there is a wireless card in it at all. This was actually a replacement laptop for the exact same one that I bought at Christmas that did the same thing. Now I am past the return window. Oh, and I\\'ve bought and installed a subscription to Microsoft 365 - money wasted probably. Bought in late Nov. Set up for wifi to download updates. Left it alone. Picked it up the other day to do some additional work and it doesn’t even recognize that it has a Wifi card. Do not buy any HP products, I have 5 HP Desktops and 2 printers. The hardware fails, & even with tech support they will transfer you to a “special department” which transfers you to another “special department” I had an issue with my pc not finding any printers in the office even though the other pcs can. Even though it was once connected. Obviously a hardware failure. Got bounced back to departments after they say oh it’s a desktop issue we’re transferring you to desktops, and then desktop transfers me to printers and back and and forth.. and back and forth.. I finally gave up. Will throw away pc. I like the laptop it\\'s fast it boots quickly, but as you can see from the photo it\\'s almost impossible to read the keys which makes it almost unusable for me. I used to always buy Toshiba, this is my first HP laptop and won\\'t be the last. Only complaint is no backlight. I recieved this item yesterday and the touch pad did not work. Called HP tech support. He was able to get into my computer and do all the updates as well as unlock the device after 2 hours the tech tells me it is a hrad ware issue and teh device touch pad is defected and to return the device. I printed off the return label only to find out that I have to pay to have this defective device in order to return. There is no contact info for the seller to discuss this issue further. Very unhappy customer Had problems from the very start! Pop up says this laptop has bad image on the c/drive. Not very reassuring for a brand new laptop! I think someone did a modification incorrectly! Buyer beware! Had Lenovo products previously and never had any problems! Laptop is fine. Just need it for work, so doesn\\'t need to be super crazy. However, it arrived with no charging cable or any way to charge it. So, not thrilled about having to fork out another $60 for one :/ I was very disappointed to find that this unit had a flaw in the screen that prevented the left 1/4 of the screen from displaying anything. It looked like a very nice computer except for the flaw in the screen I sent it back for a refund. You have to plug in charges after to hours of usage. Waste of money The battery would not charge from the start. Turns out the battery was no good. Horrible. Screen size war to small for my eye problem. Need a desktop with a large monitor. So sad. This a a perfectly adequate laptop but it does not have a touchscreen. My bad - one just assumes in this day and age but no. It was a hard adjustment from my last laptop. The keyboard works well and the screen is sharp but I still can\\'t help but try and move things with my fingers.....\\nREAD. Be sure you read before you buy. Battery doesn\\'t last long. My last laptop would last days without plugging it in. After a out 3 hrs my battery starts dying then I have to plug it in. this is an adequate computer for everyday home use. not a superior product. Home use. Had a difficult time setting up some things and getting into my Hotmail account is convoluted. Impossible to see the keyboard symbols. Dark grey on a light grey background. Hard to open. Need to pry open with two hands. But overall a good value and machine. Disgusting that this computer sold on prime day was sold as new and had another person as administrator from the UK with all his info . Had to hire someone to work to get him off😡😡😡 Not only is the laptop slow, but the graphics are terrible. I don\\'t think this has the right technical aspects needed for Windows 11. I have a Surface Pro as my workhorse, it\\'s hard to beat for speed and screen resolution. I didn\\'t need that for a second machine. This is the machine I use for browsing, social media, crafting (knitting/crochet patterns), writing, and watching videos. The larger screen works well for these tasks, and I can even have 2 items on the screen. It is rather large, so it is not easily transportable. I plan to primarily use it on a small desk in my home. Windows 11, or whatever it has, really sucks and i hate it. Its bulky and slow. I am not a fan of windows 11. There seems to be a lot of clicking with very little action. This is a throw back. I just need a machine to fill in. I guess it will do that. I bought this item for last month when i back home and see thats a beautiful but it cannot work！！！！\\nThe backlight was broken!!!!! worst screen！！！\\nnobody want it！！！！！！！ I have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, according to the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differ in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received the HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor. Half the performance!!!\\nThe Celeron N5000 processor described in the ad Title does not exist, only Intel Pentium N5000 exists. Unfortunately, these types of errors in the product announcement are not taken into account by Amazon, they are not corrected and international return costs are not assumed, in my case, from Colombia. Thus, I lose money when making the return, since the international shipping costs are very high and it ends up not making the return under the threat of losing more money.\\nI did not do well with this purchase. A processor with half the performance expected if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device!!\\n\\nI have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, based on the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differ in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received HP Chromebook - 14a- na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor.

A processor with half the performance of the expected if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device !! Its not touch screen even though it says, heavy lag, hard to use finger pad. I hate it I was disappointed that it wasn\\'t a Windows machine. I am still learning how to navigate the Chrome OS. I like the speed. This leaves my Dell Inspiron with 8 gig RAM and an i5 in the dust with half the RAM.\\nIts6a great value for the money. So usually I\\'m a pretty lazy person when it comes to returning items, like it has to be flat out awful or just not worth the hassle of keeping for me to actually return something. That being said it\\'s looking like this will have to be returned. It would have been great if not for the mouse messing up almost every second. I love the light weight and the smooth keys but this dang mouse is too annoying to keep. Guess I\\'ll spend a lil extra and get a computer that isnt used. Too bad The Chromebook itself is okay but the seller did not reset the item to factory settings and I received it with an existing account and everything was in Spanish. It took me a while to have it reset and Amazon support couldn’t help because I was told it’s a third party vendor. I was very disappointed with the entire situation. I bought this CB solely for the fact that it was advertised as keyboard being backlit. It\\'s not and I\\'m extremely disappointed. Aside from this fact, the unit performs well This chrome is limited to work. can\\'t access some files and one cant use it for some office jobs. Not good for working from home as an IT consultant and it also does not support zooms and office teams meetings. I received my laptop after rush shipment only to be disappointed because it doesn’t work! I started it up and it was stuck on the start up wifi connection screen. So I contacted technical support and they couldn’t help me didn’t even try to help me troubleshoot it. All they did was start a return for me, which I can do myself!\\n\\nI’m so disappointed because I needed this for school and now I’m out of my money due to pending refund. Now I’m having to run to Best Buy and spend more money! Photos are not true to the product. I have had two individuals now tell me it is HFMI and the photos show it is. It does notbin fact have an HDMi port. I anticipated this but the fact I\\'m being lied to about it warrants this review. Stop lying. I dislike that the computer arrived with a password from the previous owner. The process to get the guest password was ridiculous and quite annoying and frustrating! I will buy new from now on. All I have to say is this IS NOT BRAND NEW!!. Its refurbished, and if you need a new computer do not buy this. Its luck and chance it may work perfectly or not at all.🤷\\u200d♀️ BEWARE!!! USELESS!!! ITS A GLORIFIED PHONE. (W/O the calls)Bought this refurbished computer to learn the basics.. COULD NOT DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 10.. this computer SHOULD not be sold by amazon.. and I will be talking to them about taking it off the market.. if you can\\'t run windows.. than you don\\'t have a computer ... shame on either Amazon for allowing this seller to sell this.. Amazon handled it great.. as far as refund etc.. but it should not be sold.. idk what can be run on this Keep cutting off on full charge\\nIt first started cutting off on a full battery.. won’t turn on without it first being on the charger.. it froze so I tried restarting it but then it said chrome os is missing or damaged I bought this new laptop for my son. He was very frustrated when he could not use this computer for Microsoft, Apple or Steam gaming sites. Only had this Chromebook 10 months and it already took a dump. Don\\'t waste your money. It stop working after a few days and had to be returned. It only had one usb port, from camera was total garbage and it overall failed to live up to its potential. The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It\\'s very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing. Very bad, it didn\\'t help me to make my drawings with kamvas 13 I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it. The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy. Don\\'t ever buy a Chromebook it\\'s a waste of money!!!! It can not be used it is very poor quality Dumb asf, AMAZON KEEP FUCKIN UP MY MONEY Missing charger cable'"

       "'It was running smooth for the first month or so I had it, and then randomly after booting up a certain steam game it would always randomly turn off the screen and leave the actual computer on. I couldn\\'t turn the screen back on I had to restart the whole laptop. It would happen about 3 times per actual game playing session. And then I noticed it was way slower when booting up after not being used for a while. It would sit on desktop and take 3 minutes to open either Spotify, steam, google, or anything. And today it gave me the blue screen of death. I never downloaded anything fishy, just steam games Spotify and then I browsed YouTube every now and then. I remember buying a laptop from bestbuy like 3 years ago for 400$ cad and it was almost as fast as this laptop which is 1400& cad. I mean the laptop worked again after I restarted it a few times, which is good. It still sorta works. But who knows how much worse it will get over time. Might just return it instead of getting a tech guy to fix it if I can. Received the item and during setup it stopped working and went to a black screen. When contacting the seller they want me to pay to ship it back.... it doesn\\'t work why am I paying to ship it back...... Terrible to send out a computer that has been sent back before and not even checked???? little expensive Haven\\'t had a chance to play with it yet. I\\'m s long time HP user so I don\\'t think I will be disappointed. I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work. Dont listen to these other reviews. Love the colour. Great price.\\nCons: the laptop is completely slow. Gaming (sims4) is slow and glitches alot.\\nSpeaker does not go all the way up without making the music sound high pitched and scratchy. You need to get a sd card because the storage is so low on this laptop and with all the features and added apps it comes halfway full. And ad after ad pops up which is annoying. Not really a great school laptop either because it won\\'t even allow me to add my school email. Slow for download but still work well for my kids to do homework I didn’t like that fact that the computer is slow and the speaker is not loud you can barely hear anything and it keeps asking me to reset my password a lot and the touch screen is slow and the way the computer powers off is weird other than those things it works perfectly fine I’m a student attending college so I do all my homework on here it’s not bad but I would recommend this computer for games not work . Working to help other in need. Bought for streaming and web cam picture quality is horrible *Update* STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY REFUND FROM THIS ITEM AND IM ABOUT TO FILE A CLAIM AND GET THE POLICE INVOLVED! YOUR GOING TO JAIL\\nRuns very slow and i have anxiety and this makes my stress level go up so badd!!! Have been getting frustrated and crying and i just received it today :(, dont work for gaming at all! Sucks really bad so disappointed im just going to get my money back this is a useless piece of junk fr. Supplier said they would credit $20 for return shipping. It will cost more than $95 to return from Mexico. Item never worked. Who checks these out? They should be fired! I am so disappointed! Verrrry slow! I would like someone to check out my computer it is blinking on and off. Plus, it’s slow responding As soon as I started to get all my information like pin & email in.. laptop started glitching black screen and turning on and off… immediately turned it off (when I got the charge) turned it back on & was soooooo slow. I took down my information and sent it back. Replacement never got sent! After two weeks of them not shipping out the laptop I had to cancel.. terrible service. You might just end up getting the one I got if you purchased from them. So I purchased this laptop for my notary business and in the middle of handling my business the screen started blinking in and out. I\\'m highly disappointed. I had to return it because it would not turn in ! I’m very sad. This device was infected with a virus I could not isolate and delete. All of my important documents disappear and all of my personal information has been disbursed throughout the world. Whatever virus it is literally works on and off line. Crazy I hate it I was hoping for a great computer. Drivers missing to download internet. No preloaded internet app. So mad. You suck. ⚠️ Don’t waste your money on this computer it’s trash SO SLOW!!!! Got it for just regular internet browsing to make things easier rather than using my phone. SO SLOW not even worth using! Not even for how cheap it costs. Waste of money! Wish people were honest in the reviews :( I’m very disappointed that my laptop does not work! Waste of money! Need to send it back. Please give me an address to ship it to for refund. Thankyou\\nSharlet Lollar This laptop is a waste of time and money. So slow. Not to mention the touch screen randomly activates by itself. Makes trying to watch anything streaming absolutely annoying. Randomly activates settings screen. Returning. Right out of the box it froze during the registration process & would not respond to a restart, reboot or even a hard boot. Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. It works , not too slow Working to help other in need.

Within one hour I had to restart several times until it finally froze on the \"Hi there\" screen & I packed it back up for a return & refund. Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Black screen. No charging. No screws to even open it to unplug the batter...it\\'s junk. You pay for what you get. garbage...right this moment. In my trash. I like the quality and feel for the price, it was $130 and feels expensive and does everything a chromebook should. Affordable for working remotely Within a week of receiving this product, the touchpad would randomly stop working. After a while, it would start working again. This seemed to happen randomly with it working for hours then not working for hours. Since it was within the 30 days, I returned it for a full refund.\\n\\nHowever, the company stated that this touchpad is working find and only gave me a partial refund because of the restocking fee. After asking them if they looked only briefly or for a while, like my reason stated, they refused to even provide an answer. They only pointed towards Amazon customer service to ask for a full refund for me. Luckily, Amazon customer service covered the difference without any hassle.\\n\\nDon\\'t support SkyNetWorks. My excitement for getting a Chromebook to still study and write when I\\'m too sick/tired to sit up was dampened considerably when this got here.\\n\\nBasically, something is wrong with the screen. Not just in this one - the issue is still present even in the replacement that Amazon sent. It seems to have a problem with skin in particular, along with pale colors, and using the built-in \"night light\" feature or Screen Shader extension on Chrome to reduce blue light makes it worse. When watching videos, people will commonly have huge blotches of green pixels along their skin. And in normal windows, green lines and splotches will often appear for no reason at all.\\n\\nInitially I tried talking to HP Support about the issue, and they actually tried to foist me off on a \"specialist\" that I would have to pay for - to get help on a brand new Chromebook that I hadn\\'t even had for an hour yet! Thankfully Amazon support was more reasonable, and they simply offered to set up a return and send me a replacement in the meantime.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the issue is persisting even in the replacement. I can only assume it\\'s a common defect in this model now, maybe in some awful push to try and get people to buy the newer and more expensive one. Don\\'t waste your money or time - get a different Chromebook, from a different brand! UPDATE: so I returned the first one. Which I paid only $90 for it. Reordered another one; then got charged $119 plus tax for it, it still has not been shipped. Just looked at them again and now they’re asking $129 plus tax. Is this a scam???\\n\\nI just got this chrome book/laptop, and put it to charge. 3 hours later it is still dead. So frustrating. After 5 month the battery no longer taking the charge , barely used it . It’s frustrating when you trust and purchased an item and then it stop working . Whats even worst is its very costly to return items. Hoping. Someone can contact me . I had this for less than a year, too late to return, but not worth the $144 I spent for it - I took it in to have serviced, and the Geek Guy told me it is the mother board. Thought it may still be under warranty. I am going to try to get it serviced Had a hard time connecting to the internet. I rebooted, reset, troubleshoot, tech support and YouTube, nothing work. Returned the Chromebook. Looking for something different. I must have gotten a bad one. The screen would have green squiggly lines when the background was white. Don\\'t waste your $$$ after 2 weeks it no longer connects to wifi It is not for someone who is computer illiterate like the person who I sent it. They can\\'t get past the set up. I barely used this because it was intended to be a back-up for travel. Kept it permanently plugged into wall socket and used once in awhile. Last week tried to boot up and it is completely blank screen - no power. Tested wall socket with other items it was fine. Tried plugging into other sockets, still dead. Now have to hassle with manufacturer warranty! Only been using it for 5 days and this morning it won’t turn on or even charge. Piece of junk. Definitely not worth it. I have no idea why this has 4.6 stars for gaming it can’t even run a simple iPhone game without crashing or absolutely frying the inside.\\n\\nAlthough it’s not for gaming. Basically the only thing this is useful for is browsing the internet and MAYBE streaming. It’s actual price is 50$ maybe even less. I ordered 2 of theses for my grandsons. They are very disappointed with the speed of the device and often describe it as being glitchy. I would like to return them since they don’t use them. How can I return this product? Opened this less than a month ago. The screen goes black and you have to turn it off and on until you can get it to work. Unfortunately ordered early for boyfriends birthday so can\\'t return. Don\\'t waste your money. I got this for my mom for her birthday and it turned on once. Now it won’t turn on again even though we have charged it up. I never make reviews or complain about anything but just know (because I did not look into the return policy) you CANNOT RETURN. My fault for not reading that but it still sucks I bought a computer that doesn’t work. I’d recommend not buying from them and buying from another company because yours may not work either. Could not connect to Wi-Fi at Starbucks, 2 different McDonald’s, Kinko’s, or from 2 different Wi-Fi’s at an AT&T store. My phone had full Wi-Fi bars at each locale. Was finally able to connect at a laundromat. Wi-Fi sucks so I’m disappointed. Its a good laptop as long as you don\\'t want to download anything, download the GOOGLE play store or even finish setting up the stupid thing because it can\\'t connect connect my wifi. Even though everything else does. Tried to trouble shoot. Don\\'t waste your money We did not have a password saved and were unable to get support from the company to help us set one up. Now we cannot get into the machine and it is useless. Do not purchase. This computer does not work at all it’s either frozen or shutting down. Called customer support and all they had me do was turn it on and off over and over. It came defective, screen said Chrome OS missing or damaged. Couldn’t get it to work. Bought June 28 screen malfunction August 19, called company no support offered at all. Very disappointed they would not stand by their product. Cost to fix was more than I paid For it. The screen is broken, will have to be replaced. It can only be used for very simple work. The screen resolution and brightness is bad. It become very slow while multiply programs run together. Obviously not new! Pretty disappointed right now. I love everything about this laptop besides the fact that everytime I use it, it keeps shutting off and turning back on at least a few times and I’m not sure why. My Chromebook lasted a whopping two years. It was difficult to scroll and impossible to update the apps. I am pretty sure they are designed to go kaput after two years. If anyone can recommend a good small lightweight laptop please let me know! After using the Chromebook for less than 2 years I got the dreaded \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged\" message. I tried to use the \"recovery disk\" as suggested on numerous sites but to no avail. Took it to Geek Squad where they worked on it for over a week before giving it up as a lost cause. The Chromebook is scrap. The operating system is unstable and cannot be relied on. Do yourself a favour and get a computer or or tablet with a real operating system. I bought this laptop for my sister and it took over 15 mins to start up. We have great Wi-Fi connection and I did not expect this from Awful performance from an HP laptop. Buyers Beware! I’m stuck with this junk of a laptop. Wish I could give 0 stars. Horrible customer service also. This will be a back up computer as we needed it in case one of the ones that we have now goes down. Unfortunately wasn\\'t what I needed but great small computer for small jobs. Still buying HP just bigger 😁 Everything not complete Haven\\'t had a chance to play with it yet. I\\'m s long time HP user so I don\\'t think I will be disappointed. I did not want to leave a review on this because of the disappointment. Maybe I recieved a lemon. Pros: touch screen does work.

Just think, I\\'ve been waiting a week for delivery of a product that is obviously defective. Laptop arrived on time, and properly packaged! This laptop has exceeded my expectations thus far. Will followed up with a durability review after a few months of use. The \"Watchdog violation\" has been seen on Window\\'s stop code extraction. Did just a Windows update (Win11) procedure. The only third-party software installed to the moment is the Googe Drive. Yet don\\'t know the root of problem. The hard fault happened on Wi-Fi connection changing from established 5G to 2.5G within same router area. Although I like the compact size of the laptop, the absence of a calculator type numeric keypad is an inconvenience when dealing with several numbers. Purchased device in August. One morning in November, upon trying to start the computer, the screen would stay completely black. Trouble shooting showed the original 8GB of Samasung Ram had failed. Because I had added a second stick of 8GB ram (A-Tech 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz SODIMM PC4-25600 (PC4-3200AA) CL22 Non-ECC Laptop RAM Memory Module), HP would not warranty it. Just ordered a second stick from A-Tech. Make of this what you will. Bought this one for our son thats attending ASU for engineering. Added another 8G memory stick and this thing is a very capable workhorse. I need one for work travel and look forward to using it daily. Don\\'t hesitate on hitting the button. You will not be disappointed. I just wanted a laptop to pass the time but I was shocked by the quality of graphics and the benefit of such a light weight laptops mobility Have to reboot all the time as internet is slow when all the other devices in the house are fine Bought in May. In July, the unit boots up but the screen remains blank. Terrible support from Amazon and HP. Was initially told by an Amazon agent that I could have a replacement or refund no problem, but that agent ghosted us. Had to contact Amazon again and that agent put us in touch with HP. The HP agent put us through an hour and a half of ineffectual diagnostics before telling us we\\'d have to send it in for repair. So we won\\'t have use of this machine for another two weeks at least. And that\\'s assuming they can fix it! Please just give us our money back Amazon and HP! Quit wasting everyone\\'s time! Didn\\'t even last a year. First it kept disconnecting from internet every 5 minutes. Whereas my other laptop was fine. Then after 6 months it would not charge! No help from anyone and of course no warranty. Stay away from this horrible laptop! When the computer isn\\'t plugged in, the laptop won\\'t turn on. If you fully charge it, then put it to sleep..When you open it the next day the battery will be dead and it won\\'t turn on. What good is a laptop if it always has to be plugged in? Useless. Trying to figure out how to contact HP about the one year warranty. It\\'s ridiculous how hard they make it.\\n\\nFlat out, I would not recommend this or buy this laptop again. I loved it until it would not turn on one day. Took it to get checked out amd they said the motherboard went bad? Serious shortest time ever with a computer. moderate to heavy typing is only doable if you type \"blind\" or you have a detached key that shows the letters clearly. this is the worse computer I\\'ve ever had...I the middle of setting up it froze and it been 5 hours and I can\\'t shut it down...and cant get up hpI\\'ve callHP and he was it still can;yt get it started...terrible product I did not get a 8gb. It was 4gb, blue, and extremely slow. The entire laptop felt like a child\\'s toy. The screen was impossible to see. The quality overall was horrendous. I love HP, but was beyond disappointed with this product. This computer has me waiting 30 minutes just to search up something, the color is very trashy gray and dull, it is also false advertisement of 256 gbs of storage. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. Really poor quality right from the start. Computer is tricky to get to reliably turn on. Flimsy and breaks from falling less than 2 ft on a carpeted floor :-( HP will not honor any repair on accidental damage. My laptop was less than a month old when it happened. I sent it to them and HP quoted $619 to repair my $500 laptop. I will never buy HP again. I\\'m a Gmail guy I have a Gmail account I don\\'t want to change.....good luck getting past all the Microsoft monopoly malware to install chrome as a browser...super slow also Thought I bought the windows 11 version, but I guess not. And I didn’t realize this was the 2009 model…. Very disappointing. Bought/Set this up for a family member who just needed a very basic laptop. Laptop works fine but was disappointed that it doesn\\'t actually come with Windows 11 already loaded. It boots and gets you connected to the Internet and THEN it downloads and installs Windows 11. Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn\\'t going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn\\'t expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can\\'t find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn\\'t think I\\'d need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where\\'s the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn\\'t look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won\\'t run unless I\\'m connected to the internet. What? How\\'s that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I\\'m giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!! The battery is really bad it lasts only 2 hours for new PC is really bad Everything I expected If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it\\'s pretty good I use this laptop for both work and personal things. So far, no issues. My only (small) complaint is that it runs a little loud. I want to say is this is not a touch screen, which is so disappointing i absolutely cannot get used the touch pad. I have tried to no avail. I didn\\'t realize it was touch pad or i would kept looking its terrible .missed my return window Although everything else is good ,just really not able to use it Dumps wifi driver and requires hard reset at least twice a week. I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.\\n\\nFast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We\\'ve been using Dell but I figured I\\'d save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She\\'s had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP\\'s quality issues.\\n\\nUnfortunately I can\\'t return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it\\'s time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.\\n\\nI\\'m giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand. Was not happy with the quality of screen, viewing was not crisp and clear. I thought I could live without a back-lit keyboard, but it is impossible to see the keys clearly because the characters, letters, numbers are very thin and almost the same color as the keys....especially if you don\\'t have 20/20 vision. I found this computer, for the money, only average compared to what I have owned before. Disappointed that there is not a DVD player. Why wasn’t I told this? My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys. I bought this for my wife, who teaches English at a small university in Zimbabwe. She LOVES it!! She doesn\\'t game with it, so doesn\\'t need a super-fast computer. She loves the solid feel and the quick reactions. So far it does everything she needs to do with it. I like this laptop, but it is hard to see the letters on the keys. You can barely see them standing straight overtop the keyboard. I wish I had returned it, but I\\'ve already downloaded personal stuff on it. Unhappy that it had error messages when starting and then connectivity problems after that. Came without a Windows 11 CD so I can\\'t fix driver issues Only reason I ordered this one above other similar ones was because of the 1080p screen. I had no idea 1080p quality could be so lacking. IF you can handle a blurry/fuzzy display, this one is for you. Just love how fast it boots up fast which is what I was looking for.\\nHowever, this one\\'s connectivity is not good. First, I have had a few Wifi disconnects I don\\'t have on my previous HP or have with my phone on the same desk. I would never buy a computer w/o an ethernet outlet ever again. This one\\'s ports do not handle flash drive or camera media cards on its ports all so well. The media card is hard to remove and one got damaged: the little plastic slide to indicate write protected fell off. I have to tug hard to remove a USB. Also it doesn\\'t read some of my USB\\'s. I hope my old HP holds up. If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee. Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks I\\'ve had the computer for almost a year without too many issues. I just can\\'t \"connect to the internet.\" HP is uesless. I tried to contact them, but never had any luck. I tried their worthless program they install on the computer, but I can\\'t use it because I am not connected to the internet. I am using the laptop to write this, yet...somehow I am not connected to the internet. I will never buy another HP again. Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick. This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.\\n\\nIt feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.\\n\\nThe keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.\\n\\nOn the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.\\n\\n1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months\\n2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.\\n3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.\\n4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.\\n\\nThe quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.com\\n\\nThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing. The battery is simply horrible. I have to recharge every evening. Sending it back The laptop has to be shut off and restarted. NO USING the RESTART function either. I have to shut it down, wait a bit, then start it for the WIFI to reappear. All work is lost! And, you can not add anything to the task bar! All the sites I frequently use, can not be dragged & added. WTH? I have had this laptop less then 24 hours and I absolutely HATE IT! The worst experience I have before with electronic devices, computer break down within the period of warranty, went to suggested spot, the technician saying have to break it down to fix but HP doesn\\'t responsible at all. DONT PURCHASE THIS, go to grab a apple computer, definitely more expensive but worth more This computer is garbage. It\\'s slow, it\\'s cannot process. Cr2 photo files. It cannot process basic photoshop programs. It\\'s slow, I have to restart it constantly, and the screen colors are off. Do not waste your money on this! Update: Amazon made this right by offering to take this back past the return time. My friend did find a back up he made and was able to restore. That being said HP warranty was worthless. i bought this as a gift..it has had several issues..most related to disconnecting to internet although it is connected by ethernet...yesterday it crashed..we got it so far as to a PIN screen. You are unable to click any links they give you to move forward..two hours on outsourced support from HP wherein they determine it is a password issue..Mind you the computer recognizes the user but it frozen in a screen asking you to set up a PIN...support is clueless and will not give you any links to make warranty claim...sent me a link to buy a support contract.....WHILE this is under warranty..total outsourcing BS by HP why i myself use a MAC not any windows product...a birthday gift that became my problem. argh I had high hopes because I didn’t see the reviews until after I made the purchase. At that point I could only hope I wouldn’t have the same Wi-Fi issues that most other people had complained about. But sure enough, the 2nd day, after the laptop installed updates, I could not get it to connect to wifi anymore. I rebooted and tried to fix it for a little while but after reading the reviews I tried no more troubleshooting as I already knew what to expect but just hoped for a different outcome. Sending the laptop back immediately and I will just go and purchase one in store that I won’t have to troubleshoot on day two. Do not waste your time with this laptop unfortunately. And to think this was on the “Treasure Truck” but there is no treasure here. I never write reviews. Ever. But I am so disappointed after having this laptop for 4 months, the wifi stopped working. Nothing even shows up for connections. The touchpad/mouse is also not great to use, it is very touchy and ends up doing really strange things. Bought this as a Prime day deal gift for my husbands Birthday. The laptop would not power on or charge. I went through the trouble shooting instructions provided when I went to do a return (replacement was not an option offered). Only option for return is UPS pickup or pay for the return myself. I wasn\\'t sent a tracking number or a label so I could not take it to the UPS store or call UPS to reschedule when we were not home for the 1 pick up attempt. I had to cancel then resubmit the return to hopefully return this $500 paperweight. I bought this computer at the end of April and have used it maybe 10 times and I ALWAYS have an issue with being able to log in, keeps kicking me out, now the battery won\\'t charge and won\\'t work unless it\\'s plugged in. To make matters worse I tried to install the updates to see if that would help the battery and now it won\\'t let me sign in at all. Keeps looping back to the sign on screen. Don\\'t waste your money! The laptop has been doing this the second week I got it. It loses the capability to connect to Wi-Fi and then tells you to connect to Ethernet. Which I can’t because it doesn’t have an Ethernet port. So every time we have to reset the laptop to factory settings in order for it to work\\nDo I have warranty? So my first one broke. HP replaced it. Second one broke. My insurance replaced it. Third one is now broken. Do not buy this laptop. Same problem every time. The touch screen and volume stop working then the screen just goes black. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!! The computer touchpad is terrible. very sensitive and it goes all over the place. The audio jack already stopped working. Always have issuing with WI-FI connections. None of my other computers have that concern. The quality is not worth it. Awkward to use. crosshair attaches to anything it gets close to. I don\\'t want a computer deciding what I am doing. Highlights text at most inopportune times, not at my direction. Frustrating to use. Ikons too small. Purchased this laptop in November 2021. It is still under warranty but the HP website lists repair sites of UbreakIfit it. None of these sites would repair connectivity issues under the warranty. Spent three hours online with HP support tech and still unable to access the internet. We\\'ve always been satisfied with HP devices - no longer! The Amazon support CS did NOT offer to help provide a three way call to HP to fix the issue just gave us the HP 800 number. Sorry we purchased this laptop thru Amazon. It is slow and web pages \"jitter\" and takes forever to load. Not worth the price I purchased this laptop on Jun 13th and it was delivered on Jun 15th, which is the day warranty should start. HP sent a mail asking for feedback mail, in which it recognizes the purchase date to be around Jun 15th. However, when we check the warranty date, it starts on Nov 25th, 2021 (and ends warranty support Dec 29th, 2022)\\n\\nWe have tried reaching HP seller support twice to fix this, but they have still not fixed the warranty start date. this laptop has some wifi issues. when it comes back on after sleep, wifi often does not work. you will have to reboot it. this is really inconvenient. every time you close your laptop there is a high chance that you\\'ll end up having to restart the computer. sometimes, you\\'ll have to reboot it again and again until the wifi works. I am currently traveling, and this is really frustrating. I missed the return window, and I cannot even get any warranty service until I get back home. I am afraid it\\'s getting worse and it may not last until the end of my trip.. very frustrating... I’m a college student and I purchased this computer about two weeks ago. The only purpose of this computer was to do homework, I don’t download games, I don’t even use social media on this computer, all I was supposed to do was homework. Turns out I wasn’t even able to do homework!!! It keeps shutting itself off and making loud and weird sounds, keeps showing a blue screen saying that “the device ran into a problem and it needs to restart”. I tried to contact customer support but they couldn’t help me at all, I was trying to do homework and all of a sudden (after about 25 mins of homework) a blue screen shows again saying it needs to restart and IT HAS BEEN STUCK at 43% for the past hour. Worst computer ever! I’m returning and never purchasing again! mouse pad began to malfunction in first 60 days. It gets stuck when pressed, and I never spilled anything on it. Very annoying! I bought this for my wife. Ever since we have had it (3 months) it doesn’t connect to wi-fi.\\nI have luck connecting about 10 times finally over that period. Amazon will not do anything about it because they say the 30 day return policy is up. We use our phone most days for everything, but on occasion we need the laptop. Very disappointed in this product and do not recommend purchasing. Basically what I’m saying is they sold me a POS laptop that was supposedly new but I have to send it in to get it fixed??? Never had so many issues with a laptop before. Contacted HP numerous times and instead of acknowledging the laptop has an issue, they kept trying to restart it, reflash the OS, etc. with weeks of back and forth as it would work for a few days before disappearing again. worst part is after all of this time and no lasting solution, the return option on Amazon is gone, and HP is saying thats how we have to get it replaced. I would have expected better from HP... Do not recommend at all. Technically the laptop itself meets my needs, but the resident programming sucks. I do not like nor use McAfee, and having their annoying popups every few seconds makes me hate it.\\nI\\'ve gone into Control Panel to delete the program, but the popups persist. Power on and off . Just horrible product Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall. The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money! This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!! Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !! I\\'m a casual home user. This unit is awful. I don\\'t know the verbiage, but I\\'ve had nothing but problems since my purchase 2+ months ago. I still have my old HP PC which still works, it\\'s at least 10 yrs old. I\\'m done w HP. After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend. WiFi adapter is dead. Return window went out just over a month ago. Literally had this stupid thing for 5 months and now it’s useless. Only used for writing papers in word and uploading for school assignments. Avoid HP like the plague.\\n\\nUpdate 4/23/22: They were able to walk through a repair with customer support. That worked....for awhile. Now the wifi adapter is dead again... I thought it was a good deal for the amount of horse power this computer has, so I bought two of them. within the first few weeks both laptops’ network cards failed, and they\\'re unable to connect to wifi. So we\\'ve had to use usb wifi dongles. Would not recommend this product. I have bought this laptop for my business associate. As he was traveling he didn\\'t have a chance to set it up. we were trying to do now but neither wifi nor bluetooth are responding. Amazon told me 30 days passed and dismissed me. Truly bad experience. Not a great experience. The product didn\\'t work right from the beginning. It would kick off in the middle of an application and it would shut down wifi. Also, it was difficult to turn and off. This HP 15-inch Laptop is very bad product. It has wifi adapter compatibility problems. The wifi asapter is incompatible with windows 11 operating system & does not connect to the internet. It has a problem with internet connections and going dead all the time. I would give it no Stars Product failed. Hardware not working. Needed it to be ready to start grad school for my daughter this week. Would not recommend. Very disappointed. Now I have to return and buy another laptop for her first week of school. Hard to set up program and keeps updating after loading loosing information. This laptop has completely shut down and when it actually turns on now it looks like in the attached photo.\\nVery disappointed with this purchase. The wifi settings disappeared and i thought i was crazy until i had my coworker look and she notice the wifi setting wasnt there either. This laptop was defective. I returned it the very next day. I have to do a hard reboot regularly. Known problem, terrible customer support Not a good laptop stop working in less than a year welp had trouble connecting to internet did total restart now its suck on wifi screen will not go any further\\nwant to send back Whenever windows 11 updates, the wifi icon disappears so it is impossible to connect to the internet. There also is no Ethernet port. It was loaded with the wrong operating system. I would never buy this again. I just opened it and found the damage done to corners of this laptop. Poor quality management. SSD failed about 4 months into using this item. cannot return or replace. money down the toilet. I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it\\'s NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me, & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #\\'s, etc with other places before buying here. Very disappointed, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t even get that. Very fast and powerful machine but onboard wifi failed after only two weeks of operation. Very disappointing. Getting mentally prepared for the warranty repair hassles. Update: decided buying a wifi dongle was a better option then wiping data, being without it for two weeks and having to set it up again. windows 11 = bad This laptop worked fine for about a month. It took me a while to transfer data, install Google accounts, and other software. One day, I sat down to use it and the internet was not available. When you click on the ball to see you internet options - that screen is gone. I took it to a trusted computer repair store, and he said the laptop is not acknowledging that there is a wireless card in it at all. This was actually a replacement laptop for the exact same one that I bought at Christmas that did the same thing. Now I am past the return window. Oh, and I\\'ve bought and installed a subscription to Microsoft 365 - money wasted probably. Bought in late Nov. Set up for wifi to download updates. Left it alone. Picked it up the other day to do some additional work and it doesn’t even recognize that it has a Wifi card. Do not buy any HP products, I have 5 HP Desktops and 2 printers. The hardware fails, & even with tech support they will transfer you to a “special department” which transfers you to another “special department” I had an issue with my pc not finding any printers in the office even though the other pcs can. Even though it was once connected. Obviously a hardware failure. Got bounced back to departments after they say oh it’s a desktop issue we’re transferring you to desktops, and then desktop transfers me to printers and back and and forth.. and back and forth.. I finally gave up. Will throw away pc. I like the laptop it\\'s fast it boots quickly, but as you can see from the photo it\\'s almost impossible to read the keys which makes it almost unusable for me. I used to always buy Toshiba, this is my first HP laptop and won\\'t be the last. Only complaint is no backlight. I recieved this item yesterday and the touch pad did not work. Called HP tech support. He was able to get into my computer and do all the updates as well as unlock the device after 2 hours the tech tells me it is a hrad ware issue and teh device touch pad is defected and to return the device. I printed off the return label only to find out that I have to pay to have this defective device in order to return. There is no contact info for the seller to discuss this issue further. Very unhappy customer Had problems from the very start! Pop up says this laptop has bad image on the c/drive. Not very reassuring for a brand new laptop! I think someone did a modification incorrectly! Buyer beware! Had Lenovo products previously and never had any problems! Laptop is fine. Just need it for work, so doesn\\'t need to be super crazy. However, it arrived with no charging cable or any way to charge it. So, not thrilled about having to fork out another $60 for one :/ I was very disappointed to find that this unit had a flaw in the screen that prevented the left 1/4 of the screen from displaying anything. It looked like a very nice computer except for the flaw in the screen I sent it back for a refund. You have to plug in charges after to hours of usage. Waste of money The battery would not charge from the start. Turns out the battery was no good. Horrible. Screen size war to small for my eye problem. Need a desktop with a large monitor. So sad. This a a perfectly adequate laptop but it does not have a touchscreen. My bad - one just assumes in this day and age but no. It was a hard adjustment from my last laptop. The keyboard works well and the screen is sharp but I still can\\'t help but try and move things with my fingers.....\\nREAD. Be sure you read before you buy. Battery doesn\\'t last long. My last laptop would last days without plugging it in. After a out 3 hrs my battery starts dying then I have to plug it in. this is an adequate computer for everyday home use. not a superior product. Home use. Had a difficult time setting up some things and getting into my Hotmail account is convoluted. Impossible to see the keyboard symbols. Dark grey on a light grey background. Hard to open. Need to pry open with two hands. But overall a good value and machine. Disgusting that this computer sold on prime day was sold as new and had another person as administrator from the UK with all his info . Had to hire someone to work to get him off😡😡😡 Not only is the laptop slow, but the graphics are terrible. I don\\'t think this has the right technical aspects needed for Windows 11. I have a Surface Pro as my workhorse, it\\'s hard to beat for speed and screen resolution. I didn\\'t need that for a second machine. This is the machine I use for browsing, social media, crafting (knitting/crochet patterns), writing, and watching videos. The larger screen works well for these tasks, and I can even have 2 items on the screen. It is rather large, so it is not easily transportable. I plan to primarily use it on a small desk in my home. Windows 11, or whatever it has, really sucks and i hate it. Its bulky and slow. I am not a fan of windows 11. There seems to be a lot of clicking with very little action. This is a throw back. I just need a machine to fill in. I guess it will do that. I bought this item for last month when i back home and see thats a beautiful but it cannot work！！！！\\nThe backlight was broken!!!!! worst screen！！！\\nnobody want it！！！！！！！ I have purchased the 9FY38UA SERIES, according to the product description on Amazon and I have received the 1G128UA Series, which basically differ in that the 9FY38UA has a 4-core Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 processor and I have received the HP Chromebook - 14a-na0023cl (1G128UA ) with Intel® Celeron® N4000 2-core processor. Half the performance!!!\\nThe Celeron N5000 processor described in the ad Title does not exist, only Intel Pentium N5000 exists. Unfortunately, these types of errors in the product announcement are not taken into account by Amazon, they are not corrected and international return costs are not assumed, in my case, from Colombia. Thus, I lose money when making the return, since the international shipping costs are very high and it ends up not making the return under the threat of losing more money.\\nI did not do well with this purchase.

A processor with half the performance of the expected if Amazon or its subsidiary had sent me the correct device !! Its not touch screen even though it says, heavy lag, hard to use finger pad. I hate it I was disappointed that it wasn\\'t a Windows machine. I am still learning how to navigate the Chrome OS. I like the speed. This leaves my Dell Inspiron with 8 gig RAM and an i5 in the dust with half the RAM.\\nIts6a great value for the money. So usually I\\'m a pretty lazy person when it comes to returning items, like it has to be flat out awful or just not worth the hassle of keeping for me to actually return something. That being said it\\'s looking like this will have to be returned. It would have been great if not for the mouse messing up almost every second. I love the light weight and the smooth keys but this dang mouse is too annoying to keep. Guess I\\'ll spend a lil extra and get a computer that isnt used. Too bad The Chromebook itself is okay but the seller did not reset the item to factory settings and I received it with an existing account and everything was in Spanish. It took me a while to have it reset and Amazon support couldn’t help because I was told it’s a third party vendor. I was very disappointed with the entire situation. I bought this CB solely for the fact that it was advertised as keyboard being backlit. It\\'s not and I\\'m extremely disappointed. Aside from this fact, the unit performs well This chrome is limited to work. can\\'t access some files and one cant use it for some office jobs. Not good for working from home as an IT consultant and it also does not support zooms and office teams meetings. I received my laptop after rush shipment only to be disappointed because it doesn’t work! I started it up and it was stuck on the start up wifi connection screen. So I contacted technical support and they couldn’t help me didn’t even try to help me troubleshoot it. All they did was start a return for me, which I can do myself!\\n\\nI’m so disappointed because I needed this for school and now I’m out of my money due to pending refund. Now I’m having to run to Best Buy and spend more money! Photos are not true to the product. I have had two individuals now tell me it is HFMI and the photos show it is. It does notbin fact have an HDMi port. I anticipated this but the fact I\\'m being lied to about it warrants this review. Stop lying. I dislike that the computer arrived with a password from the previous owner. The process to get the guest password was ridiculous and quite annoying and frustrating! I will buy new from now on. All I have to say is this IS NOT BRAND NEW!!. Its refurbished, and if you need a new computer do not buy this. Its luck and chance it may work perfectly or not at all.🤷\\u200d♀️ BEWARE!!! USELESS!!! ITS A GLORIFIED PHONE. (W/O the calls)Bought this refurbished computer to learn the basics.. COULD NOT DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 10.. this computer SHOULD not be sold by amazon.. and I will be talking to them about taking it off the market.. if you can\\'t run windows.. than you don\\'t have a computer ... shame on either Amazon for allowing this seller to sell this.. Amazon handled it great.. as far as refund etc.. but it should not be sold.. idk what can be run on this Keep cutting off on full charge\\nIt first started cutting off on a full battery.. won’t turn on without it first being on the charger.. it froze so I tried restarting it but then it said chrome os is missing or damaged I bought this new laptop for my son. He was very frustrated when he could not use this computer for Microsoft, Apple or Steam gaming sites. Only had this Chromebook 10 months and it already took a dump. Don\\'t waste your money. It stop working after a few days and had to be returned. It only had one usb port, from camera was total garbage and it overall failed to live up to its potential. The laptop I received is not what I expected. This laptop does not want to turn on no matter what power adapter I use. The problem is with the computer itself. It\\'s very inconvenient and incredibly disappointing. Very bad, it didn\\'t help me to make my drawings with kamvas 13 I did not know that the Chromebook I purchased was ‘refurbished’ until I received it. The price pd was for a new laptop. I feel cheated. I am not happy. Don\\'t ever buy a Chromebook it\\'s a waste of money!!!! It can not be used it is very poor quality Dumb asf, AMAZON KEEP FUCKIN UP MY MONEY Missing charger cable'"
